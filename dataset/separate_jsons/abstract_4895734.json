    "AB_TITLE": "Astrocyte Endfeet Processes Enable Quantum Dynamical Continuum in the Brain to Facilitate Proton Tunneling",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Astrocyte endfeet processes ensheathing and spanning human brain neuronal cell and vasculature have associated with them highly expressed densities of water molecular channel proteins which correlate with ionic channels and potassium channel proteins. The aquaporins can act as water molecular switches for ionic transport and proton currents in channels that run in cytoplasmic membrane protein interiors and exteriors for optimizing functionality. Recently, it has been proposed that quantum coherence may play a role in the selectivity of ions and their transport through ion channels. Astrocytes are intimately involved in brain energy metabolism. There is observed highly correlated dynamics of water channels,ionic channels and proton channels,suggesting quantum mechanical effects in proton and proton controlled electron transfer phenomena. Such quantum dynamical mechanisms could possibly be enabled by astrocyte endfeet processes and associated aquaporin functions that facilitate correlated continuum effects. This can optimize energy metabolism in human brain which has disproportionate consumption of energy compared to its relative size. Astroglial and neuronal ratios are found to be highest in human brain compared to all species including primates. Protons are about 2,000 times more massive than electrons, so they have a lower probability of tunneling.Proton tunneling could increase the rate of proton pumping by lowering the activation energy needed for protons to pass through. This could work together with other processes to induce proton displacement , which could help avoid local entropy increases that can lead to neuronal death. Proton tunneling in mitochondrial electron transfer chains,ETC , has been proposed to occur through hydrogen bonds.The human brain has disproportionately elevated (~10-fold, relative to mass) energy substrate and oxygen consumption rates. These elevated metabolic rates in the brain likely depend on electron and proton tunneling in mitochondria. Astrocyte endfeet processes,aquaporin dynamics and correlated ionic transport mechanisms might play an enabling role in faxitating quantum dynamical continuum effects involving proton and electron transfer phenomena associated with energy metabolism in mitochondria. The paper elucidate the possibilities and potentials, in the light of literature discussions that are pertinent.",
