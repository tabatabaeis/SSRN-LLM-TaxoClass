    "AB_TITLE": "Code-switching in Native Authored Children’s Books: A Corpus-based Study",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Code-switching has been observed in the verbal language of younger bilingual and multilingual children; however, there is little known about the impact of code-switching, the lexical process of switching between languages, in children’s picture books. Children interact with picture books in a variety of settings, including home, school, libraries, and therapeutic environments. Inquiry into the rate of code-switching in children’s picture books offers insight about the potential amount of overall exposure to code-switching. Additionally, lesser-known languages, such as endangered indigenous languages, may have different rates within the genre of children’s picture books compared to commonly spoken languages. This study utilized corpus analysis software to examine the rate of code-switching in Native American authored children’s books and Latino authored children’s books. Results from this study demonstrate CS occurs within Native American authored books at a higher frequency when compared to non-Native authored children’s books and at a lower frequency when compared to Latino authored books. The findings from the study offer insight to apply to bibliotherapy to support appropriate cultural and linguistic interventions in counseling.",
