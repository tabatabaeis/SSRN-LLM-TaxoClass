    "AB_TITLE": "Exploring the Pivotal Role of Pyrrolidine Ring in Search of Multipotent Agents in Neurodegenerative Diseases",
    "AB_CONTENT": "In pharmaceutical science and drug design the versatility of the pyrrolidine scaffold relating to spatial arrangement, synthetic accessibility and pharmacological profile is a largely explored and most likely interesting one. In this scenario, our previous study reported the design and synthesis of a series of N-substituted aryloxymethyl pyrrolidines as enantiopure chiral compounds exploiting the stereochemical requirements for P-gp binding. We then challenged the enrolling in the field of Alzheimer’s disease of so far not ravelled targets of this chemical cliché with a structure based and computer-aided design strategy focusing on multi-target action, versatile synthesis as well as pharmacological safeness. To achieve these hits, novel derivatives were obtained and tested, and the biological data will be here presented and discussed.",
