    "AB_TITLE": "Transformative Modelling for Sustainable Mobility and Healthy Neighborhood Spatial Design: The Case of Enka",
    "AB_CONTENT": "We designed a process of transformative agent-based modelling in a neighborhood and used it in practice to understand how transformative modelling can contribute to policy formation in transition processes such as the urban mobility transition. Using the Dutch ENKA district as a case, we paid specific attention to structuring and documenting problem framing, community involvement, and integrating multiple transition perspectives such as how reducing dominance of cars and parking allows for more green and recreational areas. We did exploratory interviews, stakeholder workshops, questionnaires and constructed an agent-based model. Controversy that arose provided opportunities for more diverse viewpoints to get engaged, but also made it difficult to use the model in a group model building process. Professionals and residents that wish to support transitions, need to pay attention to language used, investigate resistance to evaluate the size of it, and must have capacity for difficult conversations as well as flexibility to adapt plans. Whether the conditions for group model building are in place is discovered throughout the process and alternative options such as transition experiments should be considered as well. When there is a committed team, the model built can be expanded to give participants insight into benefits of such experiments.",
