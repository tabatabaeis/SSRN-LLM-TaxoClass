    "AB_TITLE": "Effects of Sea Ice on Baltic Sea Eutrophication",
    "AB_CONTENT": "This study investigates the influence of sea ice on Baltic Sea eutrophication by comparing simulations from 1953 to 2017, with and without ice cover. We analyzed eutrophication indicators defined by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the Dia/Dino index, and the Trophic Transfer Index (TTI). Results show a significant impact of sea ice, especially in the early 1970s, with a decline in the late 1980s. Ice impact fluctuates with nutrient loads, amplifying eutrophication effects. Around 1988, both TTI and the Dia/Dino index indicate increased eutrophication, with ice cover significantly influencing both indicators (by approximately 30%) and promoting dinoflagellate dominance. While ice affects plankton timing and ecosystem structure, nutrient loads primarily drive spring and summer blooms. Despite nutrient input reductions, stored nutrients continue to support eutrophication. However, the reduction in sea ice cover due to climate change could potentially expedite the Baltic Sea's recovery to Good Environmental Status.",
