    "AB_CONTENT": "<p><span>Th</span><span>e article aims to carry out an analysis of the bene</span><span>fi</span><span>ts and disadvantages involving arti</span><span>fi</span><span>cial intelligence in decision-making processes. It starts with the hypothesis that arti</span><span>fi</span><span>cial intelligence tends to be positivist in its decisions, since algorithms are programmed to interpret norms and principles. </span><span>Th</span><span>us, it seeks to analyze the context of positivism in Brazilian law and what are the bene</span><span>fi</span><span>cial and harmful consequences in the use of arti</span><span>fi</span><span>cial intelligence. </span><span>Th</span><span>e deductive method is used, through the premises of Kelsen and Bobbio and critical analysis by Lênio Streck. At the end, some conclusions are drawn about the hermeneutic complexity that involves the decision-making process, pointing to cautions regarding the unrestricted&nbsp;</span><span>use of Arti</span><span>fi</span><span>cial Intelligence in decision-making processes, with supervision and human sovereignty prevailing for the realization of justice.&nbsp;</span></p>",
