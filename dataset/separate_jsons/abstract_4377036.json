    "AB_TITLE": "Language Sample Analysis of Conversation Samples from Children Who Stutter: Syntactic Abilities and Syntactic Performance",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Introduction. The purpose of the study was to compare school-age children who stutter (CWS) and age-matched children who do not stutter (CWNS) in syntactic abilities and syntactic performance. <br><br>Methods. Language Sample Analysis (LSA) was conducted on conversation samples obtained from 46 school-age CWS and CWNS between 7 and 16 years (CWS, n = 23). Syntactic abilities were assessed using the Index of Productive Syntax (the IPsyn) and Developmental Sentence Scores (DSS) and regression analyses were conducted to determine if group membership was predictive of scores in the IPsyn and DSS. Additionally, the groups were compared in the IPsyn subcategories to assess use of complex syntactic structures. Syntactic performance was assessed by: (a) Categorizing the sentences from each conversation sample into high vs. low syntactic complexity categories based on DSS scores and comparing the sentence categories in % stuttered sentences (% SS); and (b) Comparing the groups in the proportion of phrase-level disfluencies (phrase repetitions vs. revisions) that are associated with syntactic planning. <br><br>Results: In terms of syntactic ability, group membership did not predict IPsyn or DSS scores. However, the IPsyn subcategory analysis demonstrated that the CWS showed reduced use of complex than simple noun phrases. The groups did not differ significantly in the other subcategories. In terms of syntactic performance: (a) Significantly more sentences were stuttered in the high compared to the low syntactic category; (b) Compared to the CWNS who demonstrated significantly more phrase revisions, the CWS showed comparable use of phrase revisions and repetitions. Additionally, post-hoc analysis showed a significant association between verb phrase elaborations and %SS. <br><br>Conclusions: Group differences in the use of simple vs. complex noun phrases are attributed to the hypothesized roles for such units in stuttering. More stuttered sentences in the high DSS sentence category,&nbsp;use of fewer phrase revisions, and the association between stuttering and elaborated verb phrases in the CWS are interpreted to suggest limitations in syntactic planning and reformulation during ongoing articulation.",
