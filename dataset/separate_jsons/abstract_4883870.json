    "AB_TITLE": "Division of Labour in the Courts: Balancing Values in Changing Times",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Since the Industrial Revolution, the division of labour has been regarded as a central means of enhancing economic productivity, but do these benefits accrue to the adjudication of legal disputes? The rise of judicial specialisation in Australia suggests it has allowed the courts to adapt to changing times, marked by growing social complexity and heightened expectations of the role of law in regulating social order. Yet specialisation comes with risks. This paper argues that the impact of judicial specialisation should be assessed against the fundamental values of the judicial system, namely, access to justice, cost-effectiveness, impartiality, procedural fairness, just outcomes, and public trust. Using these values as a yardstick, the paper concludes that, through careful institutional design, hybrid specialisation can deliver significant benefits while mitigating potential downside costs.",
