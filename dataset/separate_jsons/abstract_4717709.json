    "AB_TITLE": "Fabrication and Evaluation of Dual-Function Nanofibers Membrane for Guided Periodontal Tissue and Bone Regeneration with Controlled Release of Alendronate Sodium",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Bone defect is one of the most common complications that come across with more severe forms of periodontitis occurring mainly due to the accumulation of osteoclasts at the inflamed site. Bisphosphonates would inhibit this process by promoting osteoclastsâ€™ apoptosis. The present study aimed to fabricate nanofibrous membranes for both guided periodontal regeneration and controlled release of alendronate sodium (ALN) in the management of periodontitis. The membranes were developed by electrospinning of polyvinyl alcohol, polycaprolactone, or a blend of them. Then, they were evaluated for in vivo performance and biocompatibility by an alternative method in rats. Uniform and randomly aligned nanofibers with a mean diameter lower than 600 nm were obtained by electrospinning. The formulation indicated suitable mechanical strength and elasticity. A controlled in vitro release profile during 168 h was observed and the formulations showed acceptable cell toxicity to be considered safe. The in vivo evaluation showed a sustained release of ALN during 28 days to the surrounding tissues without causing any irritation and damage. The ALN-loaded nanofibrous membrane showed suitable characteristics to be used as dual-function periodontal membranes with space-maintaining properties and modified release of ALN to promote bone regeneration during the recovery process.",
