    "AB_TITLE": "An Assessment of the Modifying Effects of Home Medication Use on Acute Kidney-Related Morbidity Due to Elevated Ambient Heat Exposure",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Background:Elevated ambient temperatures increase the risk for acute kidney-related morbidity, and medications use may increase vulnerability to heat exposure. We examined whether medication use, and combination medication use (i.e., polypharmacy), modifies the risk for temperature-related volume depletion (VD) and acute kidney injury (AKI).<br><br>Methods: We obtained patient-level emergency department (ED) visit data from four Atlanta-area hospitals during the warm season from 2013 to 2019. ED patient-visits who reported a medication were matched with up to 5 ED patient-visits without the medication. Medications included angiotensin converting enzymes and angiotensin receptor blockers (ACE/ARBs), antidepressants, anticonvulsants, Î²-blockers, diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and statins. We use a case-crossover framework to estimate associations between daily maximum temperature, medication use, and VD/AKI ED visits.<br><br>Results: There were 14,635 VD and 18,716 AKI ED visits in our study. For a change in ambient temperature (lags 0-4) from the 50<sup>th</sup> to 95<sup>th</sup> percentile, patients using antidepressants had a higher risk for AKI (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.08, 1.52) compared to antidepressant nonusers (1.03, 95% CI 0.95, 1.12. Polypharmacy analysis indicated that patients taking statins with ACE/ARBs were at an elevated risk for AKI (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.02, 1.86) compared to patients taking only an ACE/ARB (OR 1.00 95% CI 0.82, 1.21), only a statin (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90, 1.33), or neither (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93, 1.23).<br><br>Conclusion: Results suggest that both single and combined medication use may be associated with elevated risk for VD and AKI during periods of elevated ambient temperature.",
