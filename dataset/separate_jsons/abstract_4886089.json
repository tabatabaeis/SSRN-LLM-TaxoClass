    "AB_TITLE": "Political Neurotargeting: Ethical Challenges of Exploiting Intimate Data in Democratic Processes",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Innovations in neuroscience and neurotechnology, coupled with the social situation of increasing digitisation, hyperconnection, datafication and algorithmisation, have made it possible to access, extract and exploit large, prolific and valuable intimate data sets linked to bodily, sentimental, desiderative or mental aspects using both invasive and non-invasive digital instruments and devices. The use of these datasets to persuade and politically manipulate citizens through neurotargeting by various actors such as big technology companies, de facto powers and governments raises a number of concerns about the disruption of people's cognitive freedom, the instrumentalisation of citizens, the creation of a synthetic public opinion and the perversion of democratic processes. The aim of this article is to expose and analyse the ethical challenges to citizens' autonomy and the proper functioning of democratic processes posed by the use of political neurotargeting based on the exploitation of people's intimate data.",
    "AB_KEYWORDS": "neurotechnology, neurotargeting, profiling, intimate data, biometrics, persuasion, manipulation, ethics, democracy"
