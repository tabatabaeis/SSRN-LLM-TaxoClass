    "AB_TITLE": "A Crime in Search of a Court: Prosecuting the Crime of Aggression Against Ukraine and the Challenges of Jurisdictional Immunities",
    "AB_CONTENT": "In the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the international legal order has been thrust into a state of exigent crisis, demanding acute scholarly attention to the institutional mechanisms available for prosecuting the crime of aggression. This thesis embarks on a rigorous examination of doctrinal challenges to prosecuting aggression, with an emphasis on the largely uncharted interplay between aggression and jurisdictional immunities. \n<br>\n<br>\n<div>\n This thesis navigates the intricate legal terrain of immunities <i>ratione personae</i>—enjoyed by heads of State and other high-ranking State officials—and immunities <i>ratione materiae</i>—applicable to acts undertaken in an official capacity. In assessing such immunities’ application to aggression, I draw insights from the jurisprudence of a variety of international courts and tribunals.&nbsp; \n <br>\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n It then applies discussions of immunities to several juridical frameworks proposed for prosecuting the crime of aggression against Ukraine, including amending the Rome Statute, the creation of an ad hoc Special Tribunal for Aggression, and various hybrid models. Crucially, this thesis examines the conditions under which jurisdictional immunities are nullified and whether the proposed models would satisfy such conditions. Each model is critically evaluated for its normative solidity and feasibility in the contemporary geopolitical context marked by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. This thesis accordingly appraises these models in search of a solution that balances normative viability and political feasibility.\n</div>",
