    "AB_CONTENT": "Financing is an important part of trade; it has always been, and it will always be. The business of providing goods across states or countries is capital intensive as such, it is a necessity for businesses to raise capital to fund these movements of goods. The traditional financial institutions (hereinafter described as “TFIs'') such as retail, investment, and commercial banks, insurance companies, and brokerages have done tremendously well with respect to providing the needed funding and risk managements; however, with intra and international trade on the rise these traditional financial institutions may soon be overwhelmed with demands. This has the potential of causing chaos in the financing space. On the international stage where there is little regulation governing TFI financing, TFIs would pick and choose who to provide their capital to. TFIs would become autocratic as well. While big corporations may survive this potential chaos, small and medium scale enterprises (hereinafter described as “SMEs”) would not survive. Majorly because they do not have the finances and voice to compete with big corporations for these funds. Thus, given the importance of SMEs to world economy it is important that this chaos is prevented, and SMEs are empowered with more access to capital. For context on the importance of SMEs, the International Labor Organization in 2019 reported that SMEs are responsible for more than two thirds of all jobs worldwide. In addition, according to the World Trade Organization SMEs represent over 90% of the business population, 60-70% of employment and 55% of GDP in developed economies. SMEs hold around 20% of patents, one measure of innovation, in biotechnology-related fields in Europe.&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>\n<div>\n This paper argues that blockchain provides a unique opportunity that would not only ensure that SMEs get a chance to obtain capital, but it also provides an overview of how blockchain technology can transform intra and international trade financing. With Global Trade Finance Market size in terms of transaction value currently at USD 4.16 trillion in 2023, it is expected to grow to USD 5.00 trillion by 2028, at a CAGR&nbsp;of 3.74% during the forecast period (2023-2028). This paper argues that with the ease that blockchain technology provides, this figure has the potential to go even higher.\n</div>",
