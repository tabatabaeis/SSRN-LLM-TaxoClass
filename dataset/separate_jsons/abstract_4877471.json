    "AB_TITLE": "A 'New View' of America's Original Sin: Induced Innovation and Slavery in the Antebellum United States",
    "AB_CONTENT": "This paper conducts a textual analysis of the U.S. patents granted between 1836 and 1877 to provide evidence of the impact that slavery had on the direction of technological progress in the southern United States. The issue is framed with a standard directed technical change model (in the spirit of Atkinson and Stiglitz's (1969) \"New View\"), the \"technological bias\" of patents is identified with a Multinomial Inverse Regression (along the lines of Gentzkow et al. (2019)) and causality is tested with a difference-indifferences estimation. I find that, because the prospect of earning capital gains on \"slave capital\" increased the returns to labor-augmenting technologies in the South as compared to the North, the institution of slavery had a significant impact in directing Southern technological innovation away from capital-intense production techniques, which may be an important factor in explaining the difference in trajectories of industrial development across the two regions.",
