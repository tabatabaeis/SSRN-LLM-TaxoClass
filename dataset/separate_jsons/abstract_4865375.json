    "AB_TITLE": "Ceftazidime Pharmacokinetics in Rabbits Under High-Pressure Conditions",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Introduction: This study investigates how high-pressure environments, like deep-sea diving, impact the effectiveness and behavior of the antibiotic ceftazidime in rabbits. It aims to understand the differences in drug action between normal and high-pressure conditions to improve treatments in extreme settings.<br><br>Methods: Using a self-controlled approach, male New Zealand rabbits were first adapted to the lab environment, then given ceftazidime under normal pressure, followed by a high-pressure trial after a rest period. The study measured the drug's plasma levels at various times to assess its pharmacokinetics.<br><br>Results: Results showed that high pressure significantly affects ceftazidime's clearance and distribution in the body, with slower drug clearance observed under high pressure. This indicates the need for adjusted dosing in such conditions.<br><br>Discussion: The findings stress the importance of considering environmental pressure in drug research and suggest further studies to explore how different drugs perform under similar extreme conditions, aiming to enhance clinical practices for activities like saturation diving and hyperbaric treatments.",
