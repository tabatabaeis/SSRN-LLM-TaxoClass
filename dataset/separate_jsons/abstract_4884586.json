    "AB_CONTENT": "<p><span>In family law, child custody disputes include a nuanced interaction between legal precedent and subjective factors. The welfare principle, which puts the complete well-being of children first, is essential to these discussions. This essay examines and evaluates the welfare principle's implementation by the Indian Supreme Court in custody disputes. This study investigates which parent's or child's best interest principle the court should give priority, based on academic papers and Supreme Court case law. It explores the welfare principle's historical development and global acceptance, emphasizing the principle's importance in family law. The study highlights the difficulties and contradictions in implementing the welfare concept in the context of custody through a review of pertinent statutes and significant Supreme Court decisions. The subjectivity and ambiguity of the principle are criticized, this is especially true when considering divergent judicial interpretations. In order to secure equitable and child-centered outcomes in family law processes, particularly in the face of international custody battles, this paper finishes by highlighting the necessity of ongoing improvement of the welfare concept.</span></p>",
