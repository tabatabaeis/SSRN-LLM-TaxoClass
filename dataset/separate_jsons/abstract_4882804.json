    "AB_TITLE": "AI-Driven Alternative Medicine: A Novel Approach to Drug Discovery and Repurposing",
    "AB_CONTENT": "AIAltMed is a cutting-edge platform designed for drug discovery and repurposing. It utilizes Tanimoto similarity to identify structurally similar non-medicinal compounds to known medicinal ones. This preprint introduces AIAltMed, discusses the concept of \"AI-driven alternative medicine,\" evaluates Tanimoto similarity's advantages and limitations, and details the system's architecture. Furthermore, it explores the benefits of extending the system to include PubChem and outlines a corresponding implementation strategy.",
