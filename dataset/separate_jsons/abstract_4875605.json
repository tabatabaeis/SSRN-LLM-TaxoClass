    "AB_CONTENT": "In this paper, we investigate the Scheduling of Massive Firmware-Overthe-Air (FOTA) Updates (SMFOTAU) for connected cars. Rapidly increasing software complexities, security issues, and maintenance updates make the distribution and scheduling of such updates are extremely important for both customers and car companies. One way to deliver these updates is to perform them at the dealerships, which results in reputation damage and becomes inefficient when facing a heavy volume of frequent updates. However, car companies' trend has recently changed to the use of remote network connection technologies. In this context, the FOTA update refers to downloading either a replacement or a patch to existing software using wirelessly connected devices of selected car models with specific software versions during a specified time window, called a FOTA campaign. We propose a new twoindex MIP formulations to model the SMFOTAU by formulating various download policies and functions. To tackle the SMFOTAU, we design a Matheuristic algorithm by integrating a large multiple Neighborhood Search (NS) and commercial MIP solvers. We also develop benchmark instances for three types of cities and configurations in terms of the urban areas, number of cars scheduled for the campaign and cell towers. To assess the quality of the proposed Matheuristic algorithm, we then conduct an extensive numerical experiment by comparing our result with the result obtained by employing commercial solvers.
