    "AB_CONTENT": "The present study was conducted to assess the level of awareness among cattle farmers about Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) with respect to general disease, its transmission and prevention and control measures in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. The study was carried out among 150 cattle farmers who visited the Veterinary College and Research Institute, Tirunelveli from different areas of the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu through personal interview by using pre-tested and semi-structured interview schedule. The awareness level was measured based on the mean score obtained by cattle farmers. The study revealed that, the respondents were more aware about Lumpy Skin Disease affecting cattle and lack awareness about disease caused by virus that causes abortion in dairy animals. Whereas, respondents had more awareness about 'introduction of infected animals to the herd', 'contaminated feed and water' can transmit disease in animals and less awareness with respect to movement of cattle and ticks, mosquitoes and flies can transmit the disease in animals. Regarding, prevention and control measures, respondents had more awareness that vaccination is the effective way to control Lumpy Skin Disease in cattle and less aware in respect of 'there is no specific treatment for Lumpy Skin Disease' and 'quarantine of newly purchased animals'.",
