    "AB_TITLE": "Labor and Employment in the Securities Industry: Are Registered Securities Representatives Subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act?",
    "AB_CONTENT": "<span>Are registered securities representatives entitled to time and a half pay for working overtime? The concept seems foreign to white-collar workers in the financial services industry, most of whom are professionals or paid on the basis of commissions, or both. Yet a spate of recent federal collective actions has roiled the securities industry, challenging long-held assumptions about the applicability of minimum wage and hour laws to what had traditionally been thought of as a white-collar industry. Some federal courts have applied the overtime and minimum wage requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act to financial advisors. Recent cases applying the Fair Labor Standards Act may have simultaneously run afoul of the Congressional intent, as well as financial advisors' contractual and regulatory obligations to arbitrate employment disputes with their associated firms.</span>",
