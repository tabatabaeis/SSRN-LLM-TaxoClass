    "AB_TITLE": "The Effect of Expansion of Nurse Practitioner Scope of Practice on Early COVID-19 Deaths",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Public safety is often used as an argument against expanding scope of practice (SOP) for nurse practitioners, despite the benefit of filling unmet health care demand. As a response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, some states expanded SOP for nurse practitioners to accommodate the unprecedented health care challenge. We analyze the effect of the expansion of SOP on daily COVID-19 related mortality, exploiting the quasi-random state policy changes in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Checking different model specifications, we do not find evidence that expanding SOP for nurse practitioners during the pandemic causes adverse effects on patients measured by COVID-19 mortality.",
