    "AB_TITLE": "Tracing Feminist Waves in Arundhati Roy's Novels Through Beauvoirian and&nbsp;Cixousian Approaches",
    "AB_CONTENT": "This research paper examines Arundhati Roy's novels and feminism, using the theories of Helene Cixous and Simon de Beauvoir. Cixous and de Beauvoir's theories are relevant in understanding contemporary feminist issues, addressing patriarchal structures, and promoting global gender equality through activism and media representation. The 1990s saw a postmodern shift in feminist thought, leading to Third-Wave feminism, which sought to be traced in Roy's novels. However, scholars have debated that a new wave of feminism has arrived since 2012 and is characterized by social media activism and radical individualism in the women's world. Roy's second fiction, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, was published in 2017, 20 years after her first novel, The God of Small Things. Roy has only published two works of fiction throughout her career. Her first novel, The God of Small Things, falls within the Third-Wave feminism era, while her second, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, falls within the Fourth-Wave feminism era. The study aims to evaluate Roy's novels on the spectrum of these two waves of feminism and sketch the definition and parameters of these distinct waves. By examining Roy's novels about feminism, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of her writings and the broader feminist movement.",
