    "AB_TITLE": "The Reappearance of Nilgai (Boselaphus Tragocamelus) in Bangladesh After a Century: Conservation Approaches",
    "AB_CONTENT": "The extinct Nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) reappeared in Bangladesh in 2018. The study strives to identify its current distributional range and appropriate conservation approaches. A total of 15 Nilgais were counted in 07 districts across the country during 2018-2024. Among them, 05 were prosecuted by the communities. The highest abundance was recorded in the Thakurgaon district. Establishing a protected area in the northwestern districts near the border with India will provide them with an undisturbed natural landscape for living and breeding. Ex-situ conservation in the protected areas of Madhupur Sal Forests will provide a safe passage and habitat for them. Establishing biological corridors, buffer zones, and forest matrix can boost its population size and can protect it from further prosecution. An educational campaign will help to build public awareness in favour of conservation. Proper enforcement of the Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act 2012 and environmental justice can safeguard its existence.",
