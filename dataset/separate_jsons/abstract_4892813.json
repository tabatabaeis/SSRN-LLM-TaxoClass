    "AB_TITLE": "Health Insurance Coverage and Personal Bankruptcy Reform",
    "AB_CONTENT": "The US personal bankruptcy law provides a form of implicit insurance for adverse health shocks. The 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) increased the cost of filing for bankruptcy and reduced its insurance value. We study how this reform affected households choice of health insurance coverage, health care utilization, and medical expenditure. We find that households who are prevented to file for bankruptcy increase their average insurance coverage. This effect is entirely driven by middle-income-White households with no seizable assets. The increase in insurance coverage led to higher healthcare utilization and lower out-of-pocket expenses.",
