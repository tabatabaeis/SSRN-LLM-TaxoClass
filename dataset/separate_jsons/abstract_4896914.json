    "AB_CONTENT": "<p><span>At the American founding, the nation was an idea and, constitutionally speaking, an immensely important one. Yet, it has been easy to ignore or overlook as many scholars have claimed that the early United State more closely resembled a states system than a nationstate and that Founding-era Americans were committed to local governance. An important group of early statesmen who played an outsized role in devising the original Constitution, the United States was, properly understood, a nation.

Drawing on social contract theory, an essential framework for eighteenth-century constitutional thinking, they argued that the existence of a national social contract entitled the national government to expansive power.</span></p>",
