    "AB_TITLE": "Examining Errors in Forensic Signature Analysis: A Statistical Perspective",
    "AB_CONTENT": "This paper investigates modern viewpoints and real-world applications of statistical analysis in the forensic examination of signatures. It explores the use of confidence interval analysis and the determination of optimal sample sizes based on the desired confidence level. Furthermore, it discusses the subjective nature of expert opinions and elucidates approaches to incorporate and analyse these perspectives using relevant data and statistical tests. Lastly, the study examines the challenges associated with meeting the 'beyond reasonable doubt' standard of proof in real-world scenarios.",
