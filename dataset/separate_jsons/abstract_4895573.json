    "AB_CONTENT": "Hepatic steatosis (HS) is currently one of the most common liver diseases. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) plays a crucial role in the occurrence and progression of HS. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role and mechanisms of AHR in improving of HS by aerobic exercise. We performed an 8-week aerobic exercise intervention in high-fat diet (HFD) induced male C57BL/6J mice. Histomorphology examination and biochemical analyses were conducted to evaluate intrahepatic lipid deposition. Establishment of AHR activation model by intraperitoneal injection of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and construction of miR-29a knockdown mouse model through tail vein injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV). Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) and Western blots (WB) were performed to detect the expression of relevant genes and proteins in the liver. HFD inhibited miR-29a, upregulated the TGF-β-IDO1-KYN pathway, promoted the expression of AHR and its target genes, ultimately leading to HS. Treadmill training obviously ameliorated HS and alleviated intrahepatic genetic alterations induced by HFD. Therefore, we hypothesize that aerobic exercise may alleviate hepatic steatosis by suppressing the expression of AHR and its target genes through the miR-29a and TGF-β-IDO1-KYN pathways.",
