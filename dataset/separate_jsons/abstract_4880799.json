    "AB_CONTENT": "<span>This project re-evaluates the predictive capabilities of the Connors' VIX RSI strategy, which combines the VIX (\"Fear Index\") with the RSI indicator to exploit market overreactions and mean-reversion dynamics for short-term trading. Larry Connors, a prominent figure in financial market education, has extensively validated his mean-reversion strategies through publications and practical implementations. This study integrates machine learning methods with Connors' strategy to assess its ability to maximize the fund manager's alpha and validate its premise through rigorous causal inference. By developing an independent benchmark model using a custom-designed Genetic Algorithm (GA), the project aims to compare the efficacy of the LightGBM model against the GA for predicting buy/sell signals in the SPY500 Index. The results indicate that LightGBM outperforms the GA regarding computational efficiency, interpretability, and scalability, particularly in volatile markets. Future research will focus on implementing Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and integrating replicable feature elimination strategies to enhance GA training and portfolio optimization.</span><span><br>\n  JEL:&nbsp;</span><span>G17&nbsp;</span><span>C45&nbsp;</span><span>C63&nbsp;</span><span>G11&nbsp;</span><span>G14</span>",
