    "AB_TITLE": "Thermal Performance of Combined Annular and Longitudinal Fins-on-Tube Units in Natural Convection",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Natural convection has wide applications in various industries. However, the heat transfer rate is lower than forced convection due to lower coolant velocity. To enhance heat exchanger performance under natural convection, annular and longitudinal fins have extensive usage. In this study, a combined annular and longitudinal fins-on-tube design is proposed which aims to enhance the local air velocity in the vicinity of the unit and heat transfer by deflecting airflow. An experimental setup is constructed to investigate the effects of annular fin spacing and longitudinal fin inclination angle on thermal performance, with experimental data validating the numerical simulations. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed design in array configuration is numerically investigated. In the case of a single fins-on-tube unit with the optimal annular fin spacing, the heat transfer consistently decreases as the angle of the longitudinal fin increases from the vertical position. In this case, the highest heat transfer is achieved when the longitudinal fin inclination angle is 90Â°, which is slightly lower than that of the design without longitudinal fins. However, when used in an array with 2 rows, the units with a fin spacing of 7.14 mm achieve a 50% higher Nusselt number compared to the design without longitudinal fins, and the enhancement rises to 67% in a 5-row configuration.",
