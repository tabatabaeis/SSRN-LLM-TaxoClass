    "AB_CONTENT": "This article presents an innovative work attempting to incorporate natural deep eutectic solvent (NaDES) into real food. For this, NaDES, either alone or enriched with pigmented rice bran (RB), were used to fortify mayonnaises. The physical and oxidative stability of NaDES-fortified mayonnaises were assessed and compared to mayonnaises either lacking NaDES or containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Results showed that NaDES-fortified mayonnaises could prevent lipid oxidation. Notably, mayonnaises with NaDES2 (betaine:sucrose:water) significantly reduced lipid hydroperoxides production, 2.5 times lower than the control. Additionally, NaDES2-fortified mayonnaises maintained high tocopherols levels and reduced volatile compounds from secondary lipid oxidation. This effect is attributed to a combination of NaDES effect into the mayonnaises, such as reduced water activity and the intrinsic properties to influencing molecule distribution (anti- or pro- oxidants), ultimately limiting lipid oxidation. Finally, pre-enrichment of the NaDES phase with bioactive molecules represents an innovative perspective to promote the health benefits of formulated foods.",
