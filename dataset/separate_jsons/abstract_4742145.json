    "AB_CONTENT": "The joyfully raucous February 14 celebration of the Kansas City Chief’s Super Bowl win, attended by some one million fans, was violently disrupted by gunfire and a hail of bullets outside of Kansas City’s historic Union Station. When the smoke cleared, one woman watching the event with her family was left dead; nearly two dozen others, mostly children, were injured.<br><br>As happens too often in the wake of such national tragedies, the media used the situation to focus its lens on the purported exceptionalism and harshness of U.S. self-defense laws. Unfortunately, they once again got it wrong.",
