    "AB_CONTENT": "<p><b><span>Aims:&nbsp;</span></b><span>To identify cannabis products according to their appeal among young adults and measure product sales trends. </span></p>\n<p><b><span>Design:&nbsp;</span></b><span>Retrospective comparative study using point-of-sale data from licensed recreational cannabis retailers that include buyer age with birthyear entered by retailers. </span></p>\n<p><b><span>Setting:&nbsp;</span></b><span>California, USA.</span></p>\n<p><b><span>Participants:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Cannabis purchases by young adults (age 21-24, GenZ) were compared with older adults (age 25+) over four years (2018-2021). </span></p>\n<p><b><span>Measurements:&nbsp;</span></b><span>Sales for six cannabis product categories were analyzed using a commercial dataset with imputations and a raw dataset. Age-appeal metrics were dollar and unit sales to young adults, and dollar and unit share ratios (young adults/older adults) where a share ratio of 100 denotes age-appeal comparability. A product category was considered more young-adult appealing than others if its mean on a metric was at least one standard deviation above the grand mean across all product categories.</span></p>\n<p><b><span>Findings:&nbsp;</span></b><span>Flower (cannabis plant material) and vapor pen appealed to young adults based on absolute dollar sales, dominating young-adult spending compared with other cannabis products (37.24% and 31.83%, respectively). Vapor pen and concentrate appealed to young adults based on dollar share ratios of 152, meaning these products comprised a 52% greater share of young-adult cannabis spending relative to older-adult spending (31.83%/20.97% and 10.47%/6.88%, respectively). Less appealing to young adults were pre-roll, edible/beverage, and absorbable products (tincture/sublingual, capsule, and topical). Flower showed the largest dollar sales growth (B=+$3.50 million/month), next vapor pen (B=+$1.55 million/month). Vapor pen tied for highest growth in the percent of product dollars from the largest package size (B=0.85%/month) and showed the steepest price decline (B=-0.53 price per gram/month).</span></p>\n<p><b><span>Conclusions:&nbsp;</span></b><span>In California USA from 2018-2021, relative to older adults, young adults spent a greater share of their cannabis dollars on vapor pen and concentrate (products with high potency of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol).&nbsp;</span></p>",
