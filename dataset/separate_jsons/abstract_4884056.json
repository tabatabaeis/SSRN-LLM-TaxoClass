    "AB_TITLE": "Understanding the Stages of Covid-19 Pandemic Work from a Nursing Perspective: A Multi-Country Descriptive Study",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Background: Pandemics go through phases from identification through conclusion. Phase 5 is the most acute period and where nursing work is most intensive. The nature of working during Phase 5, however, is not well defined. The COVID-19 pandemic research suggests that the nature of nursing work changes over the course of Phase 5. To understand how to support nurses during this period, defining stages for phase 5 would more clearly differentiate how to support nurses’ work.Objective: To discern the temporal stages of Phase 5 of pandemic response implementation and the impact on nurses’ work.Design: Opt-in, online qualitative descriptive design with a comprehensive demographic profile.Setting(s):  Thirteen countries representing different levels of socioeconomic development.Participants: Nurses who worked in any role between January 2021 and February 2022 who resided in Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Ghana, Hong Kong (China), Israel, Mexico, Mongolia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, South Korea, Ukraine, and the United States. Since the survey was posted online through social media and other channels, participants from other countries also contributed.Methods: Since there are no standardized measures of nurses working during pandemics, the team developed the instrument’s questions based on existing evidence and consensus-based approaches were used to finalize the instrument. The instrument was then translated from English into the eight languages of the consortium country leads using standardized approaches. Online convenience sampling approaches guided data collection. Demographic data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Descriptive thematic analysis structured the qualitative data analysis of data in English, Spanish, and Korean.Results: Worldwide, 2,600 nurses and midwives started the survey with 23% not completing any questions and 12% not meeting eligibility criteria; thus resulting in a final sample size of n=1,814 who answered 90% of all questions and producing 6,483 qualitative data points for analysis. Results identified ongoing occupational risk factors for nurses during the pandemic’s second year, including mental health ones, yet showed some improvements in access to personal protective equipment and resources. Four themes resulted from the qualitative analysis and highlighted role changes, living states, and insights into pandemic response implementation.Conclusions: Findings suggest there are common experiences of nurses working pandemics associated with the structural factors of care delivery. Additionally, at least two distinct stages of pandemic response implementation demarcated by treatment availability (e.g. vaccine development). Social reproduction associated with the political economy of gender further influences experiences during pandemic response stages.",
