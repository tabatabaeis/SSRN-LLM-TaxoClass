    "AB_TITLE": "Integrated Surface-Subsurface Rock Zonation of the Early Bartonian Reservoir in Central Tunisia and Eastern Tunisian Offshore",
    "AB_CONTENT": "This study encompasses two parallel investigations: the first utilizes subsurface data from the carbonate bank facies of the Reineche member in the Pelagian Platform near the Kerkennah archipelago. The second examines outcrop analogs in the lagoonal facies of the Siouf member, a lateral equivalent of the Reneiche member, in Central Tunisia. Gamma-ray and sonic logs of the Reineche Member in the southern and southeastern Pelagian Platform (Tunisian offshore) identify three limestone units (A, C, and E), transitioning to a single mud-dominated limestone.",
    "AB_KEYWORDS": "Sequence stratigraphy, Nummulite-rich limestone, Carbonate diagenesis, Reservoir characterization, Carbonate porosity"
