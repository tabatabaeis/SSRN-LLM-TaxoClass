    "AB_CONTENT": "The ability to associate different sensory stimuli, such as olfactory cues and food reward, involves complex interactions within the brain. Yet, specific genes called &apos;memory gene&apos; or &apos;learning gene&apos; governing these processes remain largely unidentified. Our research focuses on a neuronal gene called taxi, a potential candidate previously unexplored in this context. Transcriptome analysis of taxi-knockout Drosophila heads indicates that already known several genes related to learning and memory are differentially expressed. We hypothesize that taxi is integral and tested for different taxi mutants for sugar reward-driven learning and memory in Drosophila larvae. The mushroom bodies in the brain are key centers for learning and memory. Furthermore, several studies have highlighted the role of octopaminergic and dopaminergic neurons in appetitive-reward learning and as input neurons to the mushroom bodies. We predicted that taxi-knockdown in these specific neuronal types will impair behavioural responses for which different groups of taxi-knockdown Drosophilalarvae targeting the mushroom bodies, octopaminergic neurons, and dopaminergic neurons were tested. These larvae underwent a behavioural paradigm consisting of an olfactory-gustatory reward association training session followed by a two-choice task with temporal preferences comparison to evaluate sugar reward learning. In conclusion, this study reports taxi gene to be involved in food reward-driven odour cue learning for the first time.",
