    "AB_TITLE": "Assessment of Community Electrification in Ghana: Case of Krachi Nchumuru District",
    "AB_CONTENT": "This study investigates the potential of indigenous renewable energy sources to improve electricity access in Ghana, with a focus on hybrid energy systems for sustainable development. The Krachi-Nchumuru District was selected due to its low electricity access rate of 62.1% compared to higher rates in southern Ghana. Using HOMER Pro 3.11.2 software, system sizing and design for community electrification were assessed. The techno-economic analysis identified a hybrid system combining solar, wind, and biogas with the national grid as the most economical option. Sensitivity analysis indicated that a lower discount rate reduces the cost of energy (COE). Increasing the renewable energy fraction from 0% to 75% in 25% increments reduces emissions and COE, though the net present cost (NPC) does not follow the same trend and the initial cost rises with a higher renewable fraction. Charts of economic values and emissions provided a comprehensive understanding of the system from both the power supplier's and consumers' perspectives. The optimal renewable fraction was found to be 50% for suppliers with a biogas-solar-grid design, while consumers preferred 75%. These findings demonstrate that using indigenous renewable energy sources in Ghana is feasible and economically beneficial. By implementing proper strategies, Ghana can achieve 100% electricity access and 10% renewable energy penetration in the national mix by 2030, especially in areas with low electricity access",
