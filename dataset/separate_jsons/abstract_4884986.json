    "AB_TITLE": "Review Of: “Experiment (Nanoelectronic Memory) Using Small Organic Molecules Chlorophyll Pseudo Instead of Charge Storage Capacitors”",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Note: In electrical conduction from a conductor to a semiconductor or an electrically changeable insulator, nanotubes depend on their molecular chiral structure and angle. Since carbon nanotubes are able to pass electric current through the ballistic transfer of electrons without friction from their surface-this current is a hundred times higher than the current that passes through a copper wire-the nanotube is an ideal choice for building nano memory cloud chips. Creating chipsNano memory cloud-Nano memory cloud is made of carbon nanotubes. Although the discovery of small carbon nanotubes has been very resistant, flexible, and conductive, with dimensions equal to DNA strands, and the use of small organic molecules to absorb charge instead of charge storage capacitors in nanotype memory chips. Nanocrystals, whose use causes The life span of nano memories to increase, is involved. Indeed, using nanotechnology, the storage capacity of information can be increased by a thousand times or more. Storing information is a very important and necessary topic that can be addressed in different ways through the cloud and nano memories. One of the new tools for storing information is the use of nickel quantum dots in nanometer sizes, which are expected to be used to store terabytes of data. According to cloud nano memories, there is high potential for activity in this field. The structure and design of supercapacitors based on nanoelectronics store 100 times more charge than electrolyte types in the same volume and are charged and discharged much faster than batteries.",
