    "AB_CONTENT": "This study recreates aspects of the life and death of a young adult male who died during the siege of Roca Vecchia, a Bronze Age fortified coastal site in Italy. The partially charred individual, Roca US813A, was found among the debris in the southern room of the main gate to the city.We present the detailed macroscopic and microscopic study of this individual using taphonomical, traumatological, micro-CT, forensic and stable isotope indicators, in order to investigate circumstances of his death, which may be the first secure evidence of a Middle Bronze Age (MBA) war casualty in Italy. In addition to detailed information about the manner of death of this individual, we discuss implications for peopling of the site, tactics in Bronze Age warfare, and the nature of relations between Roca and the Aegean region.",
