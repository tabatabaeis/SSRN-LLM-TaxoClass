    "AB_TITLE": "Death sentences to Sal (<i>Shorea robusta</i>) Forests of <i>Rangtia, Sherpur</i>, Bangladesh",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Once, the Rangtia Sal (Shorea robusta) Forests in the Sherpur district of Bangladesh were highly rich in floral and faunal diversity. The forests have been degraded severely and now consist of a few isolated patches of natural vegetation. Therefore, the study aimed to identify the factors causing the degradation. Based on empirical data collected through personal interviews, it was revealed that Rubber gardening caused a massive degradation of the ecology. The orchestrated wildfire perils the herbs, shrubs, climbers, trees, and regenerations. an influential quarter and a class of dishonest people are involved in stone extraction freely by cutting the hills. Consequently, horrendous destruction of the natural vegetation coverage and ecosystem occurred there. In addition, the hilltop collapses due to digging the bank of the small waterfall for stone and sand extraction. It was noted that under the social afforestation scheme, invasive Acacia trees replaced a vast natural forest (72%), which jeopardized biodiversity. Merciless encroachment of the forest land is going on in various techniques. Most of the forest land was converted into agricultural and commercial land. The absence of deadwood has caused the disappearance of the bird community.",
