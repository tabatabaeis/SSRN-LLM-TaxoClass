    "AB_CONTENT": "Drawing on social identity theory, we investigate whether politicians exhibit hometown favoritism when allocating scarce capital resources, and explore how the intensity of politicians' birthplace identity influences their tendency towards favoring hometown firms. Using the turnover of politicians responsible for the nationwide IPO approval process in China and the resulting \"birthplace shock\" during the lengthy approval process for IPO applicant firms, we document the causal effect of politicians' hometown favoritism on capital resource allocation. Hometown firms are on average 15 percentage points more likely to receive IPO approval. This effect is stronger when politicians have a stronger sense of birthplace identity. Moreover, we show that hometown favoritism distorts capital resource allocation. Thus, our findings extend the existing nonmarket strategy literature by incorporating a unique social identity perspective to elucidate the influence of powerful politicians on firm outcomes and the efficiency of societal capital resource allocation.",
