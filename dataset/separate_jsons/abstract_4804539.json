    "AB_TITLE": "The Androgen Receptor Gene and Both Violent and Nonviolent Offending: Evidence from National Statistics on Crime Victimization",
    "AB_CONTENT": "The androgen receptor (AR) gene, located on the X chromosome, is known to help regulate bodily exposure to testosterone, a process that begins within the first trimester after conception and continues throughout life.  Particularly among males, most studies have found an inverse correlation between the number of CAG repeats on this gene (sometimes known as AR CAGn) and serious forms of physical aggression.  The present study was undertaken to determine if a link between AR CAGn and physical aggression might exist at an ecological level of analysis.  We made this assessment by comparing the average number of AR CAG repeats in a sizable number of countries with the rates of crime victimization in those countries.  Results supported the hypothesis that, as national average CAG repeats among males increases, the rates of both violent and nonviolent crime victimization decrease.  This tendency was especially strong for violent offending after statistically controlling for the proportion of each country’s population that was between the ages of 15 and 29, an age range associated with the greatest probability of crime.",
