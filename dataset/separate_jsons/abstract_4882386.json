    "AB_TITLE": "Cosmic Web Dynamics, Oscillatory Systems Feedback Processes and Cosmological Connectome",
    "AB_CONTENT": "The intracluster medium and intergalactic space dynamics can define cosmic web energy mechanisms and oscillatory systems with feedback processes and signalling pathways so as to define an information and radiation and matter exchange nerwork that could be depicted as a quantum deformed oscillatory system with interacting bosonic and fermionic regimes and representing a cosmological connectome. The quantum deformed oscillatory systems as described in the article can enable entangled states involving non local connectivities to define a cosmological connectome as a signaling and energy exchange network. The energy dynamics with signaling pathways and quantum deformed oscillator algebras enable fine tuned feedback processes that facilitate information-processing in cosmic web filaments associated with the interactions of matter and radiations in intra cluster and intergalactic medium, described in detail here.",
