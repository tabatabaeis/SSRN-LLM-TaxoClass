    "AB_CONTENT": "The delineation of the “public interest” concept has sparked impassioned debates across various academic disciplines. In law, “public interest” has also been frequently invoked by judges and policymakers as a token of the highest, overarching principle to indicate the moral rightfulness of their decisions. In fields of information law, “public interest” has been interpreted in divergent ways and infused with multifaceted connotations. For instance, in traditional media law, courts treat the “public interest” as an objectified concept, correlating it with the substantive meaning of the message conveyed. Within the copyright law framework, the “public interest” is used as a comparative notion, juxtaposing the dual objectives of promoting public access to information with the need to incentivize the intellectual creation of authors. Telecommunications law and digital platform law embrace a hybrid version––procedurally facilitating the whole process of information transmission and economically enhancing the competition in the marketplace. Data law also adopts a comparative lens to understand public interest, balancing the interests vested in the free flow of information against the imperatives of data security and privacy.&nbsp;<br><br>However, such fragmented readings of the public interest will inevitably precipitate conflicts when these fields converge. Unconscious of this complexity, decision-makers have adjudicated cases and developed rules with inevitably high uncertainty and instability. To address these tensions, this Article introduces a novel understanding of the public interest—the Economically Conceptualized Informational Public Interest (ECIPI)—as a higher governing principle to mitigate the derived conflicts and calibrate different fields of information law. This Article argues that, when conflicts occur, the best way to promote the informational public interest is to enable maximally diverse information to compete in a free market, where information consumers can access and accept information of any desired quality at relatively lower costs. Linking the ECIPI to the consumer welfare theory that has been well-established for the physical good market, this Article delineates four properties and three parameters of the ECIPI and clarifies its relationship with other relevant doctrines and theories. Ultimately, this Article establishes a framework based on the ECIPI to reconcile different fields of information law, aiming at a higher degree of harmony and consistency in judicial rulings and policy decisions.",
