    "AB_CONTENT": "<p><span>Since I wrote my last article, the Supreme Court has held that abortions are not guaranteed by the Constitution, leaving it for states to decide whether the unborn deserve personhood status or, conversely, a mother may abort the unborn child during some window in her pregnancy.&nbsp;Meanwhile, and less headline-grabbing, lower courts have continued to give more and more credence to the embryo-as-property notion, with many state supreme courts enforcing not just IVF and surrogacy contracts—but a recent high court going so far as to honor one years&nbsp;</span><em>after</em><span>&nbsp;the child was born. While perhaps not readily apparent, these two trends are, in my view, on a collision course.</span></p>\n<p>I thus write this essay to elucidate that tension and offer a perspective on where things now stand. I do so by revisiting the challenge I laid out in my last article, arguing that fathers have a constitutional claim to demand due process before and, even, after an abortion takes place: the necessary consequence of courts continuing to recognize embryos as “property” of their progenitors. From there, I address why a court faced with such a challenge would find no easy answers, having to grapple with the looming implication that, if not property, then embryos must be&nbsp;<em>persons</em>&nbsp;for whom the “right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the [Fourteenth] Amendment.”&nbsp;<span>But if embryos are property, then fathers should have what seems to be a constitutional basis for challenging abortions as deprivations of their “property” interests without due process of law.&nbsp;</span></p>",
