    "AB_TITLE": "FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE OF ANIMERE LANGUAGE IN GHANA",
    "AB_CONTENT": "The study aimed to explore the factors contributing to the decline of the Animere language in Ghana by delving into its historical context, linguistic features, cultural significance, and the broader socioeconomic dynamics at play. Employing a qualitative research design, the study conducted in-depth interviews with ten respondents from the Animere-speaking community, structuring the interview guide into four sections to focus on specific aspects of the Animere language. Through thematic analysis, the research identified several factors contributing to the language's decline, including external influences like media and education, internal community dynamics, generational shifts, and socioeconomic motivations, while also highlighting the deep cultural significance of the language and its role in shaping the identity of its speakers. The study acknowledged limitations in its sample size and geographical scope, primarily focusing on specific regions where Animere speakers reside, suggesting that future research could benefit from a larger sample and a more diverse geographical representation. The findings underscore the need for educational reforms, media engagement, community initiatives, policy interventions, and economic incentives to address the decline of the Animere language. It calls for collaborative efforts involving educators, policymakers, community leaders, and media professionals to rejuvenate and celebrate the rich linguistic heritage of Animere. This research offers a comprehensive exploration of the decline of the Animere language, bridging the gap between linguistic research and socio-cultural dynamics, and provides valuable insights for linguists, anthropologists, policymakers, and community leaders interested in language preservation and cultural heritage.",
