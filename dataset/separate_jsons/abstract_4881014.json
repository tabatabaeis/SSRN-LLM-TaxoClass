    "AB_TITLE": "Research on the Aesthetics of Architectural Space in the Alhambra Palace",
    "AB_CONTENT": "In this paper, the focus is on the aesthetics of two significant architectural spaces within the Alhambra Palace. The study delves into the correlation between the environment and architectural space, as well as the intertwining of Seljuk and Nasrid design principles within these interiors. The theoretical framework is based on how regional or site-specific distinctions can enhance comprehension of the approach and experience of architecture. This is implemented through an open-ended and non-prescriptive methodology. Observation and photography are demonstrated as effective tools within this framework, allowing for the collection of data that can either challenge or support existing knowledge. The objective is to reconsider how architecture is interpreted and to underscore the significance of empirical methods in the study of pre-modern Islamic architecture. A key finding is that, despite being constructed centuries apart, both spaces appear to convey similar cultural or ethereal interpretations in the hands of the architects.",
