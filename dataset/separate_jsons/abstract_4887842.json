    "AB_TITLE": "The Effect of Singapore's Sugar-Sweetened-Beverage Advertising Ban on Product Entry",
    "AB_CONTENT": "We estimate causal effects of Singapore's 2019 announcement of an advertising ban on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). The announced ban stipulated that beverages with added sugar content beyond a threshold would no longer be allowed to be advertised. Our focus is on how the ban announcement affected companies' SSB product launch decisions in subsequent years. Specifically, we quantify whether the ban announcement reduced the average amount of added sugar in newly launched products in six of the most popular SSB categories in Singapore. We find a significant impact in four of the six categories: the average sugar content in newly launched products decreased by 38% in instant coffees, 24% in soft drinks, 21% in iced coffees, and 18% in juices. We find that the declines are driven to a greater extent by higher rates of product introductions (with respect to the control group) at the low end of the sugar distribution and less so by lower rates of product introductions at the top end of the sugar distribution.",
