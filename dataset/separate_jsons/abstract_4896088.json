    "AB_TITLE": "Assessing the Sustainability of Kilongo Forest Reserve under Community-Based Management in Wangingómbe District, Njombe Region, Tanzania",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Over the past three decades, community forest management regimes, which involve collaborative decision-making for forest resource management, have been the dominant form of forest management in the global south. Among other things, this management regime has been associated with improving both forest conditions and community livelihoods. Recent studies, however, indicate that forests under community-based forest management (CBFM) are decreasing, subjecting them to degradation and complete land use change. This study, therefore, assesses the sustainability of Kilongo Forest Reserve under CBFM in Wangingómbe District, Njombe Region, Tanzania. Data was collected from 90 heads of Kilongo Sub-Village households in the study village of Masaulwa using probability and non-probability approaches through structured interviews, indepth interviews, and documentary reviews. The results showed that Kilongo Forest Reserve conditions improved noticeably over the 20-year period under CBFM through increased forest",
