    "AB_CONTENT": "The recent direct missile and drone attack by Iran on Israel on April 13, which involved a significant deployment of 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles, marks a profound shift in the Middle Eastern geopolitical landscape. This event, not only the first of its kind since the Islamic revolution of 1979 but also remarkably extensive, signals a break from the traditional engagement rules that confined hostilities primarily within the borders of Syria and Iraq.",
