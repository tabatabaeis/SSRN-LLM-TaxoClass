    "AB_TITLE": "The Relative Unfamiliarity with Constitutional Conventions in Modern Codified Legal Systems - The Portuguese Example",
    "AB_CONTENT": "<span>Constitutional conventions are one of the most disputed concepts of constitutional theory, triggering “passionate” debates and controversies.&nbsp;</span><span>Constitutional conventions and other informal practices were traditionally studied by Anglo-Saxon doctrine. Yet, they received scarce attention from the modern civil law tradition, with the notable exception of Italy.&nbsp;</span><span>Auspiciously, constitutional conventions began slowly getting attention from civil law scholarship, as jurisdictions moved away from strict readings of&nbsp;</span><span>the Kelsenian pure theory of law and embraced the richness of unwritten constitutionalism.&nbsp;</span><span>This chapter explores constitutional conventions within the civil law tradition, focusing on the Portuguese constitutional conventions and praxes regarding the formation and full functioning of the Government. Although constitutional conventions have never been enforced (nor recognized) by the Portuguese courts, they are still part of the constitutional arena. The constitutional crisis of 2015 is a good example of the relevant role conventions play in Portugal as non-legal binding constitutional practices.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>",
