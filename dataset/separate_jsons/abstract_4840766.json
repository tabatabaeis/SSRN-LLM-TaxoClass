    "AB_TITLE": "The Vital Role of Cash Transfers: Lessons from the Largest Energy Subsidy Reform in the Developing World",
    "AB_CONTENT": "This paper examines the effect of cash transfers during the 2010 energy subsidy reforms in Iran, which provided monthly lump-sum payments to Iranian citizens, excluding non-Iranian residents. We show that the reform generates a 17% income gap and a 12% poverty rate gap between cash and non-cash recipients, leading to a nutrition gap and changes in parental behaviors affecting children. Health data reveal a growth gap for children exposed to the reform early in life, especially among low-income groups. Counterfactual analysis shows that without transfers, cash recipients would share similar poverty rates and income distributions with non-cash recipients.",
