This shift to online learning has reported heightened instances of “contract cheating”, or also known as academic commissioning. The study partakes a concurrent mixed-methods design to explore further the aspect of contract cheating. Upon using Pearson correlation coefficient, the behaviors of students to conduct contract cheating is correlated to their academic integrity awareness. On the other hand, the motivations and intentions of students to conduct contract cheating is correlated to their academic integrity awareness and attitudes toward contract cheating. It is inferred that contract cheating among college students, especially at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, has significantly increased. It was determined further that “technological advancements”, “increased academic pressures”, and “lack of proctoring and surveillance measures” were the highest factors that contributed to contract cheating during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p></span>",
