    "AB_TITLE": "Adaptation Planning of Container Ports in the Context of Typhoon Risks: The Case of Ningbo-Zhoushan Port in China",
    "AB_CONTENT": "As important nodes in container transportation, container ports are vulnerable to risks posed by climate change. Typhoons with high frequency and destructive power could cause great damage and loss to coastal and inland container ports of various countries every year. This study conducts a comprehensive survey of the risk of typhoon to container ports by assessing the risk level of typhoons in China’s major container ports, predicting their economic losses, and evaluating corresponding adaptation measures. This study analyzes adaptation measures in response to typhoon impacts, with an in-depth case study of Ningbo-Zhoushan port, one of China’s most representative regional ports. It identifies the inadequate supply of institutions and the absence and misbehavior of the main port stakeholders as the main cause of varying institutional imperfections in the port adaptation system. This study contributes to the development of efficient port typhoon prevention policies, reduction of economic losses and casualties, and improvement of port operational efficiency. It is also a pioneering attempt to fill the gap in research on climate risk and adaptation in China’s container ports, with great significance for enhancing port resilience in the post-epidemic era.",
