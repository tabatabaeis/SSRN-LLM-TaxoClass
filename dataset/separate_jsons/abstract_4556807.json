    "AB_TITLE": "Decoding Aging Hallmarks at the Single-Cell Level",
    "AB_CONTENT": "Organismal aging exhibits wide-ranging hallmarks in divergent cell types across tissues, organs, and systems. The advancement of single-cell technologies and generation of rich datasets have afforded the scientific community the opportunity to decode these hallmarks of aging at an unprecedented scope and resolution. In this review, we describe the technological advancements and bioinformatic methodologies enabling data interpretation at the cellular level. Then, we outline the application of such technologies for decoding aging hallmarks and potential intervention targets and summarize common themes and context-specific molecular features in representative organ systems across the body. Finally, we provide a brief summary of available databases relevant for aging research and present an outlook on the opportunities in this emerging field.",
