		"AB_TITLE" : "Language Sample Analysis of Conversation Samples from Children Who Stutter: Syntactic Abilities and Syntactic Performance",
		"AB_CONTENT" : "Introduction. The purpose of the study was to compare school-age children who stutter (CWS) and age-matched children who do not stutter (CWNS) in syntactic abilities and syntactic performance. <br><br>Methods. Language Sample Analysis (LSA) was conducted on conversation samples obtained from 46 school-age CWS and CWNS between 7 and 16 years (CWS, n = 23). Syntactic abilities were assessed using the Index of Productive Syntax (the IPsyn) and Developmental Sentence Scores (DSS) and regression analyses were conducted to determine if group membership was predictive of scores in the IPsyn and DSS. Additionally, the groups were compared in the IPsyn subcategories to assess use of complex syntactic structures. Syntactic performance was assessed by: (a) Categorizing the sentences from each conversation sample into high vs. low syntactic complexity categories based on DSS scores and comparing the sentence categories in % stuttered sentences (% SS); and (b) Comparing the groups in the proportion of phrase-level disfluencies (phrase repetitions vs. revisions) that are associated with syntactic planning. <br><br>Results: In terms of syntactic ability, group membership did not predict IPsyn or DSS scores. However, the IPsyn subcategory analysis demonstrated that the CWS showed reduced use of complex than simple noun phrases. The groups did not differ significantly in the other subcategories. In terms of syntactic performance: (a) Significantly more sentences were stuttered in the high compared to the low syntactic category; (b) Compared to the CWNS who demonstrated significantly more phrase revisions, the CWS showed comparable use of phrase revisions and repetitions. Additionally, post-hoc analysis showed a significant association between verb phrase elaborations and %SS. <br><br>Conclusions: Group differences in the use of simple vs. complex noun phrases are attributed to the hypothesized roles for such units in stuttering. More stuttered sentences in the high DSS sentence category,&nbsp;use of fewer phrase revisions, and the association between stuttering and elaborated verb phrases in the CWS are interpreted to suggest limitations in syntactic planning and reformulation during ongoing articulation.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Music is a team sport. Like most art, it is often improved by collaboration. Contributions by the featured artist, backing musicians, songwriting collaborators, and even outside artistic influences can all play a large role in the final musical product. Another set of individuals also plays a considerable, and usually unseen, role in crafting a song— technicians. Technicians (producers and engineers) play a critical role in shaping a song into something commercially viable, but often, they are left out of conversations surrounding copyright. Even though technicians often make important creative contributions to recordings, they are almost never considered “authors” of the resulting work.<br><br>That should change. Technicians should have a seat at the copyright table. These artistic collaborators should own the art they help create—and just as importantly, be compensated for it. The compensation structure for technicians is often ambiguous. Many technicians are hired by artists who, because of royalty arrangements with record labels, may lack the funds to pay technicians. While industry customs have developed to account for this, relegating technicians’ pay to industry custom is concerning. Copyright ownership provides certainty and negotiating leverage to technicians. An ownership interest could take the form of recognition via joint authorship or a statutory royalty scheme for radio play. The Music Modernization Act shows that Congress can reimagine the relationship between music and copyright. The law should go a step further by recognizing collaborators’ contributions.",

Bisphosphonates would inhibit this process by promoting osteoclasts’ apoptosis. The present study aimed to fabricate nanofibrous membranes for both guided periodontal regeneration and controlled release of alendronate sodium (ALN) in the management of periodontitis. The membranes were developed by electrospinning of polyvinyl alcohol, polycaprolactone, or a blend of them. Then, they were evaluated for in vivo performance and biocompatibility by an alternative method in rats. Uniform and randomly aligned nanofibers with a mean diameter lower than 600 nm were obtained by electrospinning. The formulation indicated suitable mechanical strength and elasticity. A controlled in vitro release profile during 168 h was observed and the formulations showed acceptable cell toxicity to be considered safe. The in vivo evaluation showed a sustained release of ALN during 28 days to the surrounding tissues without causing any irritation and damage. The ALN-loaded nanofibrous membrane showed suitable characteristics to be used as dual-function periodontal membranes with space-maintaining properties and modified release of ALN to promote bone regeneration during the recovery process.",

Using the Dutch ENKA district as a case, we paid specific attention to structuring and documenting problem framing, community involvement, and integrating multiple transition perspectives such as how reducing dominance of cars and parking allows for more green and recreational areas. We did exploratory interviews, stakeholder workshops, questionnaires and constructed an agent-based model. Controversy that arose provided opportunities for more diverse viewpoints to get engaged, but also made it difficult to use the model in a group model building process. Professionals and residents that wish to support transitions, need to pay attention to language used, investigate resistance to evaluate the size of it, and must have capacity for difficult conversations as well as flexibility to adapt plans. Whether the conditions for group model building are in place is discovered throughout the process and alternative options such as transition experiments should be considered as well. When there is a committed team, the model built can be expanded to give participants insight into benefits of such experiments.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis, which is considered as a threat to food security in the Horn of Africa. In Kenya, RVF is the 5th ranked priority zoonotic disease due to its high morbidity and mortality, frequent outbreak events, and associated socioeconomic impacts during outbreak events. In 2018, an RVF outbreak was confirmed in Kenya&apos;s Siaya, Wajir, and Marsabit counties. During this outbreak, 30 people were confirmed infected with RVF through laboratory tests; 21 in Wajir, 8 in Marsabit, and 1 in Siaya Counties.Seventy-five (75) households (15 cases and 60 controls) were selected and interviewed using a case-control study design in 2021 (?). A case was a household with a member who was diagnosed with RVF in 2018. In addition, a total of 1029 animals were purposively selected within these households and serologically tested for RVF. The study aimed to estimate the contribution of various risk factors to RVF human occurrence in Kenya with a special focus on Wajir County. Wajir County was chosen due to high number of confirmed human cases reported in the 2018 outbreak. A univariable regression model revealed that owner-reported RVF virus exposure in livestock significantly increased the odds of an RVF human case in the household by 32.7 times (95% CI 4.0–267.4). The respondent being linked to a goat flock that was IgG-positive increased the odds of an RVF human case by 3.8 times (95% CI 1.17-12.3).  In the final multivariable analysis, the respondent being linked to their own animals affected by RVF increased odds of having an RVF human case in the household by 56.9 times (95% CI 4.6-700.4), while the respondent being linked to a neighbor household member affected decreased odds of having a RVF human case by 0.1 times (95% CI 0.08-0.75).In summary, these results have revealed a potential link for the spread of RVF infection from animals to humans in pastoralist households, hence it is critical to carry out targeted, community education, One Health surveillance, prevention, and control measures against the disease. This will be critical to protecting humans against potential spillovers of infections during outbreak events in livestock.",

This study analyzes adaptation measures in response to typhoon impacts, with an in-depth case study of Ningbo-Zhoushan port, one of China’s most representative regional ports. It identifies the inadequate supply of institutions and the absence and misbehavior of the main port stakeholders as the main cause of varying institutional imperfections in the port adaptation system. This study contributes to the development of efficient port typhoon prevention policies, reduction of economic losses and casualties, and improvement of port operational efficiency. It is also a pioneering attempt to fill the gap in research on climate risk and adaptation in China’s container ports, with great significance for enhancing port resilience in the post-epidemic era.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Analyzing a near-universe sample of conventional, conforming mortgages in the United States originated and securitized between 2018 and 2019, we find that single women pay higher mortgage rates and up-front fees, and they are less likely to refinance when interest rates decrease compared to single men. This gender gap in mortgage costs and refinancing behavior is especially notable in affluent neighborhoods with high incomes, levels of education, and socioeconomic status. Part of this gap can be attributed to differences in math scores between genders during elementary and middle school, and gender gaps in financial literacy skills, which increase with income and education. These findings align with prevailing gender stereotypes and societal norms, contributing to disparities in financial sophistication that result in comparatively less favorable financial outcomes for women.",

While past research calls into question this ability in humans, I ask whether artificial intelligence is able to play mixed strategies appropriately. I have it interact in a two-player, 2x2 zero-sum game where the opponent takes a fixed, pre-selected strategy. I devise three tests of optimal behavior. First, I show that AI does not play mixed strategies appropriately in that the empirical frequency of play does not match equilibrium predictions when playing against an opponent who is playing the equilibrium strategy. Second, it exhibits positive serial correlation in its play. In addition, I include treatments where its opponent exhibits either perfect negative serial correlation or perfect positive serial correlation. Given positive serial correlation in its play, in games where AI's opponent also exhibits positive serial correlation AI does well, but when playing against an opponent exhibiting negative serial correlation its earnings tend to be negative. Third, I extend the game to consider two additional treatments where in one AI's payoff is reduced in one cell of the game matrix and another treatment where its opponent's payoff increases. While Nash equilibrium predicts AI's behavior will respond to changes in its opponent's payoff and not adjust behavior when its payoff changes, I show that AI does the opposite.

One way to deliver these updates is to perform them at the dealerships, which results in reputation damage and becomes inefficient when facing a heavy volume of frequent updates. However, car companies' trend has recently changed to the use of remote network connection technologies. In this context, the FOTA update refers to downloading either a replacement or a patch to existing software using wirelessly connected devices of selected car models with specific software versions during a specified time window, called a FOTA campaign. We propose a new twoindex MIP formulations to model the SMFOTAU by formulating various download policies and functions.

This has the potential of causing chaos in the financing space. On the international stage where there is little regulation governing TFI financing, TFIs would pick and choose who to provide their capital to. TFIs would become autocratic as well. While big corporations may survive this potential chaos, small and medium scale enterprises (hereinafter described as “SMEs”) would not survive. Majorly because they do not have the finances and voice to compete with big corporations for these funds. Thus, given the importance of SMEs to world economy it is important that this chaos is prevented, and SMEs are empowered with more access to capital. For context on the importance of SMEs, the International Labor Organization in 2019 reported that SMEs are responsible for more than two thirds of all jobs worldwide.

It looks into the different aspects of field level experience and practice of the NGO-MFIs working in Bangladesh. To identify the clients' perspective on deposit mobilization by MFIs, this paper presents findings from a study, which was conducted for Micro-credit Regulatory Authority and represents sample survey of 450 members of different NGO-MFIs working in the 4 divisions namely Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, and Khulna. A structured questionnaire was used to conduct the survey which was developed through literature review and finalized through pilot survey. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. Descriptive statistics such as tables, simple percentage, correlations etc. were used to describe the situation. Results show that MFIs are filling the gaps of the financial services required by vast majority of relatively poor people having no access to the banking system, and thus working as a complementary segment of overall financial system of the country with demands for more services to render. One of the major demands registered is the access to more flexible system of deposit by the rural people besides their demand for greater volume of credit flow, that still remain only partially fulfilled.",

We analyzed eutrophication indicators defined by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the Dia\/Dino index, and the Trophic Transfer Index (TTI). Results show a significant impact of sea ice, especially in the early 1970s, with a decline in the late 1980s. Ice impact fluctuates with nutrient loads, amplifying eutrophication effects. Around 1988, both TTI and the Dia\/Dino index indicate increased eutrophication, with ice cover significantly influencing both indicators (by approximately 30%) and promoting dinoflagellate dominance. While ice affects plankton timing and ecosystem structure, nutrient loads primarily drive spring and summer blooms. Despite nutrient input reductions, stored nutrients continue to support eutrophication. However, the reduction in sea ice cover due to climate change could potentially expedite the Baltic Sea's recovery to Good Environmental Status.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Issues in co-evolutionary population dynamics have long been studied via computationally intensive simulations of minimally simple agent-based models, known as Evolutionary Spatial Cyclic Games (ESCGs), involving multiple interacting biological species in which each agent has its own unique spatial location in a cell on a regular lattice, and can move from cell to cell over time. Many papers have been published exploring the dynamics of ESCGs where competitive inter-species predator\/prey relationships are modelled via the cyclic game Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) for three species, or Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) for five. At the core of these simulations is the Elementary Step (ES), in which one or two agents are chosen at random to either compete to the death, or to reproduce, or to move location. ESCG studies typically involve executing trillions of ESs and hence the computational efficiency of the core ES algorithm is a key concern. In this paper I demonstrate that the de facto standard \"Original ES\" (OES) algorithm is computationally inefficient both in time and in space due to the implicit execution of many \"no-op\" commands (i.e., commands that do nothing) and because at steady state large numbers of cells can be empty, and yet empty cells serve no purpose. I present a new Revised ES (RES) algorithm which eliminates these inefficiencies, and I show empirically that ESCGs with RES exhibit qualitatively the same characteristics as those with OES, and are also markedly more stable. The more stable dynamics of RES-based simulations means that they can be run with smaller lattices than when using OES, leading to reductions in total simulation times of 80% or more.

		"AB_CONTENT" : "The paradoxical development of visual generative AI tools, such as OpenAI’s DALL-E 3, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, simultaneously signal a renaissance and a potential dark age in visual rhetoric and communication. On the one hand, these tools democratize the creation of visual content, empowering attorneys and others to become artists and illustrators of their legal communications without needing to learn how to draw. These AI systems can simplify complex legal concepts, bridge language barriers, and enhance advocacy. But on the other hand, the proliferation of deepfakes presents significant challenges for visual rhetoric. Deepfakes can quickly and easily create realistic but false images, videos, and audio that exploit celebrities, distort facts, and facilitate various crimes. The negative implications of deepfakes include their association with fraud, misinformation, and emotional harm. This technological advancement undermines the credibility of genuine news photography and other highly representational media as the public struggles to distinguish real from fabricated content and begins to discount all visual media. The challenge lies in using the tools effectively while maintaining the verisimilitude and integrity of representational visual media, which traditionally relies on its status as an unembellished depiction of reality to achieve its rhetorical and communicative goals.<br><br>The ethical and professional questions raised by manipulated images extend to the decision whether to edit or alter visual content to improve the communication of the message and enhance understanding while still acknowledging the lurking risk of misleading or confusing the audience with altered or manufactured media. The article suggests best practices for using generative AI responsibly:<br><br>Use Non-representational Visuals: Favor diagrams, charts, drawings, and illustrations over highly representational media to avoid the pitfalls of staged, manufactured, or altered representational imagery.<br><br>Disclose Staged Images: Always inform the audience when an image has been staged or recreated to maintain transparency and trust.<br><br>Provide Original and Enhanced Versions: Present the original image alongside any enhanced version to allow for critical examination and comparison.<br><br>The article concludes by emphasizing the need for vigilance in working with manipulated visuals and detecting the possible deceptions of the works of others. Given the ease with which AI can alter images, lawyers and judges must remain aware of their biases and heuristics in assessing visual evidence, recognizing that even analog photographs and videos do not represent definitive “truths.” The advent of AI-generated visuals necessitates a reassessment of the ethical use of visual media in legal communications to preserve the power of visuals in legal rhetoric.",

This hermeneutic interpretive research was conducted using qualitative content analysis of greater than 500 code enforcement complaint documents submitted to a municipal code enforcement agency over 12 months. The phenomenological research was guided by the following research questions: 1.What indicators are identified by content analysis in a complaint document received from the community of shareholders of a municipal code enforcement agency? 2. What manner of delivery of a complaint document is most frequently exercised by the shareholders of a municipal code enforcement agency? 3. What may the frequency of violations recognized in complaint documents inform a municipal government of a community and its needs? 4. How may a municipal government advance the results of a content analysis of code enforcement complaint documents towards promoting improvements in a community? The theories of symbolic interactionism and Actor-Network Theory (ANT) were used within the methodological paradigms of hermeneutics and phenomenology to understand the function and experience of a complaint document within the code enforcement system and its shareholders. The findings of this research identify how the content analysis of code enforcement complaints can reveal and prioritize the needs, threats, and trends that impact a community and lead to municipal programs that focus on those community issues with collaborative conflict resolution programs that can improve the sense of community for its shareholders, its government and the field of conflict resolution.",

To understand how to support nurses during this period, defining stages for phase 5 would more clearly differentiate how to support nurses’ work.Objective: To discern the temporal stages of Phase 5 of pandemic response implementation and the impact on nurses’ work.Design: Opt-in, online qualitative descriptive design with a comprehensive demographic profile.Setting(s):  Thirteen countries representing different levels of socioeconomic development.Participants: Nurses who worked in any role between January 2021 and February 2022 who resided in Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Ghana, Hong Kong (China), Israel, Mexico, Mongolia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, South Korea, Ukraine, and the United States. Since the survey was posted online through social media and other channels, participants from other countries also contributed.Methods: Since there are no standardized measures of nurses working during pandemics, the team developed the instrument’s questions based on existing evidence and consensus-based approaches were used to finalize the instrument. The instrument was then translated from English into the eight languages of the consortium country leads using standardized approaches. Online convenience sampling approaches guided data collection. Demographic data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Descriptive thematic analysis structured the qualitative data analysis of data in English, Spanish, and Korean.Results: Worldwide, 2,600 nurses and midwives started the survey with 23% not completing any questions and 12% not meeting eligibility criteria; thus resulting in a final sample size of n=1,814 who answered 90% of all questions and producing 6,483 qualitative data points for analysis. Results identified ongoing occupational risk factors for nurses during the pandemic’s second year, including mental health ones, yet showed some improvements in access to personal protective equipment and resources. Four themes resulted from the qualitative analysis and highlighted role changes, living states, and insights into pandemic response implementation.Conclusions: Findings suggest there are common experiences of nurses working pandemics associated with the structural factors of care delivery. Additionally, at least two distinct stages of pandemic response implementation demarcated by treatment availability (e.g. vaccine development). Social reproduction associated with the political economy of gender further influences experiences during pandemic response stages.",

We find that female judges made more severe decisions post-movement, which almost closed the gender gap. Moreover, we explore a potential mechanism of gender norms, documenting evidence for improved awareness of gender equality among women following the movement and stronger effects on judges' gender gap reduction in regions with higher (awareness of) gender equality.

At the county level, a 1% increase in health care prices reduces per capita labor income by 0.27%, increases flows into unemployment by approximately 0.1 percentage points (1%), lowers federal income tax receipts by 0.4%, and increases unemployment insurance payments by 2.5%. The increases in unemployment we observe are concentrated among workers earning between $20,000 and $100,000 annually. Finally, we estimate that a 1% increase in health care prices leads to a 1 per 100,000 population (2.7%) increase in deaths from suicides and overdoses.

Results showed that NaDES-fortified mayonnaises could prevent lipid oxidation. Notably, mayonnaises with NaDES2 (betaine:sucrose:water) significantly reduced lipid hydroperoxides production, 2.5 times lower than the control. Additionally, NaDES2-fortified mayonnaises maintained high tocopherols levels and reduced volatile compounds from secondary lipid oxidation. This effect is attributed to a combination of NaDES effect into the mayonnaises, such as reduced water activity and the intrinsic properties to influencing molecule distribution (anti- or pro- oxidants), ultimately limiting lipid oxidation.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role and mechanisms of AHR in improving of HS by aerobic exercise. We performed an 8-week aerobic exercise intervention in high-fat diet (HFD) induced male C57BL\/6J mice. Histomorphology examination and biochemical analyses were conducted to evaluate intrahepatic lipid deposition. Establishment of AHR activation model by intraperitoneal injection of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and construction of miR-29a knockdown mouse model through tail vein injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV). Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) and Western blots (WB) were performed to detect the expression of relevant genes and proteins in the liver. HFD inhibited miR-29a, upregulated the TGF-β-IDO1-KYN pathway, promoted the expression of AHR and its target genes, ultimately leading to HS. Treadmill training obviously ameliorated HS and alleviated intrahepatic genetic alterations induced by HFD. Therefore, we hypothesize that aerobic exercise may alleviate hepatic steatosis by suppressing the expression of AHR and its target genes through the miR-29a and TGF-β-IDO1-KYN pathways.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Astrocyte endfeet processes ensheathing and spanning human brain neuronal cell and vasculature have associated with them highly expressed densities of water molecular channel proteins which correlate with ionic channels and potassium channel proteins. The aquaporins can act as water molecular switches for ionic transport and proton currents in channels that run in cytoplasmic membrane protein interiors and exteriors for optimizing functionality. Recently, it has been proposed that quantum coherence may play a role in the selectivity of ions and their transport through ion channels. Astrocytes are intimately involved in brain energy metabolism. There is observed highly correlated dynamics of water channels,ionic channels and proton channels,suggesting quantum mechanical effects in proton and proton controlled electron transfer phenomena. Such quantum dynamical mechanisms could possibly be enabled by astrocyte endfeet processes and associated aquaporin functions that facilitate correlated continuum effects. This can optimize energy metabolism in human brain which has disproportionate consumption of energy compared to its relative size. Astroglial and neuronal ratios are found to be highest in human brain compared to all species including primates. Protons are about 2,000 times more massive than electrons, so they have a lower probability of tunneling.Proton tunneling could increase the rate of proton pumping by lowering the activation energy needed for protons to pass through. This could work together with other processes to induce proton displacement , which could help avoid local entropy increases that can lead to neuronal death. Proton tunneling in mitochondrial electron transfer chains,ETC , has been proposed to occur through hydrogen bonds.The human brain has disproportionately elevated (~10-fold, relative to mass) energy substrate and oxygen consumption rates. These elevated metabolic rates in the brain likely depend on electron and proton tunneling in mitochondria. Astrocyte endfeet processes,aquaporin dynamics and correlated ionic transport mechanisms might play an enabling role in faxitating quantum dynamical continuum effects involving proton and electron transfer phenomena associated with energy metabolism in mitochondria. The paper elucidate the possibilities and potentials, in the light of literature discussions that are pertinent.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Over the past three decades, community forest management regimes, which involve collaborative decision-making for forest resource management, have been the dominant form of forest management in the global south. Among other things, this management regime has been associated with improving both forest conditions and community livelihoods. Recent studies, however, indicate that forests under community-based forest management (CBFM) are decreasing, subjecting them to degradation and complete land use change. This study, therefore, assesses the sustainability of Kilongo Forest Reserve under CBFM in Wangingómbe District, Njombe Region, Tanzania. Data was collected from 90 heads of Kilongo Sub-Village households in the study village of Masaulwa using probability and non-probability approaches through structured interviews, indepth interviews, and documentary reviews. The results showed that Kilongo Forest Reserve conditions improved noticeably over the 20-year period under CBFM through increased forest",

		"AB_TITLE" : "Does the Abolition of Direct Payments for Consultations Reduce Emergency Room Visits? Evidence from a French Natural Experiment",
		"AB_CONTENT" : "We analyze the effects of a 2017 French reform that removed direct payments for all the care consumed by pregnant women after the 6th month of pregnancy. Direct payments create a liquidity constraint on individuals' income that can deter care consumption, especially among low-income individuals. In France, a free complementary health insurance (CHI) managed by the National Health Insurance (NHI) already exists to exempt the care consumption of low-income individuals from direct payments. Therefore, this study investigates whether there are still individuals who are constrained by the price of a medical consultation despite the existence of this free CHI. To do so, we use a sample of the exhaustive database on individuals' care consumption, the SNIIRAM. This database records all outpatient care and hospital care consumed by almost all the French population. Using a triple differences estimator, we estimate the causal impact of the reform on the number of outpatient consultations, and the number of ED visits made by pregnant women. We find that the abolition of direct payments led to a small increase in the number of General Practitioner (GP) consultations of pregnant women (+6.5 consultations by month per 100 women). This result suggests that a small proportion of pregnant women was still subject to liquidity constraints for care, despite the existence of the free CHI. Then, we examine the possible spillover effects of the reform on the number of visits to the Emergency Department (ED). Since direct payments were not required in most EDs before the reform, pregnant women with liquidity constraints could substitute an ED visits to a GP consultation to avoid the payment of a consultation upfront. We find no effect of the reform on the number of ED visits made by pregnant women, but cannot conclude between absence of effect or lack of statistical power. Put together, the results provide empirical evidence that the presence of direct payments for outpatient consultations restricts the access to GP care of liquidity constrained pregnant women, and do not seem to encourage the use of EDs for non-urgent conditions. This paper contributes to a very scarce literature on the liquidity sensitivity of health care consumption in high-income countries. These findings provide useful information for the public debate about extending the exemption of direct payments for care to the general French population.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Natural convection has wide applications in various industries. However, the heat transfer rate is lower than forced convection due to lower coolant velocity. To enhance heat exchanger performance under natural convection, annular and longitudinal fins have extensive usage. In this study, a combined annular and longitudinal fins-on-tube design is proposed which aims to enhance the local air velocity in the vicinity of the unit and heat transfer by deflecting airflow. An experimental setup is constructed to investigate the effects of annular fin spacing and longitudinal fin inclination angle on thermal performance, with experimental data validating the numerical simulations. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed design in array configuration is numerically investigated. In the case of a single fins-on-tube unit with the optimal annular fin spacing, the heat transfer consistently decreases as the angle of the longitudinal fin increases from the vertical position. In this case, the highest heat transfer is achieved when the longitudinal fin inclination angle is 90°, which is slightly lower than that of the design without longitudinal fins. However, when used in an array with 2 rows, the units with a fin spacing of 7.14 mm achieve a 50% higher Nusselt number compared to the design without longitudinal fins, and the enhancement rises to 67% in a 5-row configuration.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Many countries seek to improve their pension systems by introducing corporate and individual savings plans to address the challenges of demography, social security, and economy. However, the establishing of a long-term, reliable savings system encounters multiple impediments. The retrospective analysis of Russian pension reforms offers some recommendations on solving the typical problems faced by reformers. Thus, in 2002 the Russian pension system was implemented by a mandatory savings pillar, which 20 years later the Ministry of Finance substituted by voluntary savings. As this period appeared shorter than the average life span, this measure proved ineffective in increasing pension payouts for future retirees. The frequent regulatory changes and the shrinking workforce coverage as the state prioritized the welfare of the current pension recipients also infringed upon the interests of future retirees. Pension savings investments were further affected by the economic policy aimed at the minimal return requirements which resulted in a more conservative asset allocation strategy and inefficient active management in non-state pension funds. The study demonstrates that policy actions to overcome these impediments and to raise the replacement rates for future retirees should include (a) steady regulations within a pension savings system of no shorter than 40 years; (b) the savings pillar covering no less than 80% of the workforce; and (c) the asset allocation strategy involving a bigger share of equity, longer time horizon and clear benchmarks. These recommendations can be applied to emerging market economies concerned with improving and reforming their pension systems.",

Cixous and de Beauvoir's theories are relevant in understanding contemporary feminist issues, addressing patriarchal structures, and promoting global gender equality through activism and media representation. The 1990s saw a postmodern shift in feminist thought, leading to Third-Wave feminism, which sought to be traced in Roy's novels. However, scholars have debated that a new wave of feminism has arrived since 2012 and is characterized by social media activism and radical individualism in the women's world. Roy's second fiction, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, was published in 2017, 20 years after her first novel, The God of Small Things. Roy has only published two works of fiction throughout her career. Her first novel, The God of Small Things, falls within the Third-Wave feminism era, while her second, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, falls within the Fourth-Wave feminism era. The study aims to evaluate Roy's novels on the spectrum of these two waves of feminism and sketch the definition and parameters of these distinct waves.

Yet, specific genes called &apos;memory gene&apos; or &apos;learning gene&apos; governing these processes remain largely unidentified. Our research focuses on a neuronal gene called taxi, a potential candidate previously unexplored in this context. Transcriptome analysis of taxi-knockout Drosophila heads indicates that already known several genes related to learning and memory are differentially expressed. We hypothesize that taxi is integral and tested for different taxi mutants for sugar reward-driven learning and memory in Drosophila larvae. The mushroom bodies in the brain are key centers for learning and memory. Furthermore, several studies have highlighted the role of octopaminergic and dopaminergic neurons in appetitive-reward learning and as input neurons to the mushroom bodies. We predicted that taxi-knockdown in these specific neuronal types will impair behavioural responses for which different groups of taxi-knockdown Drosophilalarvae targeting the mushroom bodies, octopaminergic neurons, and dopaminergic neurons were tested. These larvae underwent a behavioural paradigm consisting of an olfactory-gustatory reward association training session followed by a two-choice task with temporal preferences comparison to evaluate sugar reward learning. In conclusion, this study reports taxi gene to be involved in food reward-driven odour cue learning for the first time.",

The Krachi-Nchumuru District was selected due to its low electricity access rate of 62.1% compared to higher rates in southern Ghana. Using HOMER Pro 3.11.2 software, system sizing and design for community electrification were assessed. The techno-economic analysis identified a hybrid system combining solar, wind, and biogas with the national grid as the most economical option. Sensitivity analysis indicated that a lower discount rate reduces the cost of energy (COE). Increasing the renewable energy fraction from 0% to 75% in 25% increments reduces emissions and COE, though the net present cost (NPC) does not follow the same trend and the initial cost rises with a higher renewable fraction. Charts of economic values and emissions provided a comprehensive understanding of the system from both the power supplier's and consumers' perspectives. The optimal renewable fraction was found to be 50% for suppliers with a biogas-solar-grid design, while consumers preferred 75%. These findings demonstrate that using indigenous renewable energy sources in Ghana is feasible and economically beneficial. By implementing proper strategies, Ghana can achieve 100% electricity access and 10% renewable energy penetration in the national mix by 2030, especially in areas with low electricity access",

		"AB_TITLE" : "Informational Public Interest",
		"AB_CONTENT" : "The delineation of the “public interest” concept has sparked impassioned debates across various academic disciplines. In law, “public interest” has also been frequently invoked by judges and policymakers as a token of the highest, overarching principle to indicate the moral rightfulness of their decisions. In fields of information law, “public interest” has been interpreted in divergent ways and infused with multifaceted connotations. For instance, in traditional media law, courts treat the “public interest” as an objectified concept, correlating it with the substantive meaning of the message conveyed. Within the copyright law framework, the “public interest” is used as a comparative notion, juxtaposing the dual objectives of promoting public access to information with the need to incentivize the intellectual creation of authors. Telecommunications law and digital platform law embrace a hybrid version––procedurally facilitating the whole process of information transmission and economically enhancing the competition in the marketplace. Data law also adopts a comparative lens to understand public interest, balancing the interests vested in the free flow of information against the imperatives of data security and privacy.&nbsp;<br><br>However, such fragmented readings of the public interest will inevitably precipitate conflicts when these fields converge. Unconscious of this complexity, decision-makers have adjudicated cases and developed rules with inevitably high uncertainty and instability. To address these tensions, this Article introduces a novel understanding of the public interest—the Economically Conceptualized Informational Public Interest (ECIPI)—as a higher governing principle to mitigate the derived conflicts and calibrate different fields of information law. This Article argues that, when conflicts occur, the best way to promote the informational public interest is to enable maximally diverse information to compete in a free market, where information consumers can access and accept information of any desired quality at relatively lower costs. Linking the ECIPI to the consumer welfare theory that has been well-established for the physical good market, this Article delineates four properties and three parameters of the ECIPI and clarifies its relationship with other relevant doctrines and theories. Ultimately, this Article establishes a framework based on the ECIPI to reconcile different fields of information law, aiming at a higher degree of harmony and consistency in judicial rulings and policy decisions.",

		"AB_TITLE" : "Design and Performance of the Climate Change Initiative Biomass Global Retrieval Algorithm",
		"AB_CONTENT" : "The increase of Earth observations from space in recent years supports improved quantification of the carbon stored in terrestrial vegetation and fosters studies that relate satellite measurements to biomass retrieval algorithms. However, satellite observations are only indirectly related to the carbon stored in the vegetation. Ground surveys provide biomass stock measurements to act as reference for training the models, but they are sparsely distributed spatially. Here, we address this problem by designing an algorithm that harnesses the interplay of satellite observations, modeling frameworks and reference measurements, and generates global estimates of above-ground biomass (AGB) density that meet the requirements of the scientific community in terms of accuracy, spatial and temporal resolution. The design was adapted to the amount, type and spatial distribution of satellite data available around the epoch 2020. The retrieval algorithm estimates AGB annually by merging AGB estimates derived from C- and L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter observations with a Water Cloud-type of model and without the support of AGB reference data at the same spatial scale of the SAR data. This model is integrated with functions relating forest structural variables, which were trained on spaceborne LiDAR observations and AGB sub-national statistics. The yearly estimates of AGB are successively harmonized using a cost function that minimizes spurious fluctuations arising from the moderate-to-weak sensitivity of the SAR backscatter to AGB. The spatial distribution of the AGB estimates was correctly reproduced, but over-predictions occasionally occurred in the low AGB range (< 50 Mg ha-1) and under-predictions in the high AGB range (> 300 Mg ha-1). The precision of the estimates was mostly between 30% and 80% relative to the estimated value. The results were a consequence of the limited sensitivity of SAR observations to AGB and the generalizations made within the modeling framework to allow reliable retrieval worldwide at the expense of accuracy. While the framework is well founded, it can be improved by incorporating additional satellite observations that capture structural properties of vegetation (e.g., from SAR interferometry, low-frequency SAR, or high-resolution observations), a dense network of regularly monitored high-quality forest biomass reference sites, and refinement of forest structural parameters in the model to better reflect regional differences.",

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees the companies responsible for disseminating in their SEC filings any conflicts of interest of their fairness opinion providers. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regulates the fairness opinion providers who supply conflict of interest information to their client companies. We use the fairness opinion setting to assess the effectiveness of each regulator's enforcement efforts and to examine whether they improve or degrade enforcement when they enforce jointly. We find each regulator is effective when acting independently. However, when FINRA begins to regulate the disclosure in transactions previously enforced by only the SEC, regulatory effectiveness diminishes. The result suggests the SEC delegates some of the enforcement tasks to FINRA when FINRA is present even though FINRA does not directly enforce the SEC filers. Our cross-sectional tests show that the reduction in enforcement effectiveness under joint regulators is smaller when the SEC faces fewer resource constraints or joint oversight is more needed.

Our analysis indicates that, following the implementation of CECL, banks have moved away from using accounting earnings-based measures of performance in compensation contracts to equity-based or revenue-based measures. Furthermore, we find that the total executive compensation increased, consistent with the higher risk premium demanded by bank executives.

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Online matching platforms suffer from a common problem-an extremely high proportion of men relative to women. This gender skew in favor of men negatively affects the welfare and user experience of women participants, since it incentivizes men to adopt an odds-based approach to starting interactions on the platform. Men tend to cast a wide net in terms of the women they contact without fully considering whether they represent a good fit. This results in significant congestion and high search and cognitive costs for women participants, eventually leading to reduced activity or exit from the platform. In this paper, we study the efficacy of a specific platform-level intervention intended to reduce the congestion faced by women, thereby improving their overall user experience on the platform. We consider \"gender gating\", an intervention that restricts the profile visibility of women in a leading matrimonial platform to counterparties who satisfy conditions based on age, education, income, and marital status. These restrictions are based on institutional and social norms prevalent within the matrimonial matching context in India, where our experiment is set. Using a quasiexperimental setup, where the treatment is implemented in one subdomain of the platform, we use a differencein-difference style analysis to test the effectiveness of the gender gating treatment on congestion, matching efficacy, and the level of agency experienced by women. Our analysis shows that the gender-gating intervention had the desired effect-women in the treatment group received fewer (unwanted) contact requests relative to a control group, thereby reducing congestion. Importantly, the intervention resulted in higher matching efficacy and more agency in that women initiated more contacts themselves. Our work highlights the challenges women face on online matching platforms due to gender skew-related congestion and shows how platform design can help mitigate these challenges. We also show how social norms can be suitably incorporated into platform design to enhance the platform experience for minority participants, allowing for a better overall platform experience for all participants.",

We further show no substantial evidence supporting an increase in matched dyads due to mobile adoption, contrary to the research coming from less institutionalized settings (Jung et al. 2019). These findings support our propositions, that IUOPs do not benefit from the increased sense of disinhibition and impulsiveness observed in dating platforms, where they can stimulate user engagement, broaden search parameters, and enhance matching outcomes.

		"AB_CONTENT" : "With the goal of better understanding stimulation in crystalline rock for improving enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), the EGS Collab Project performed a series of stimulations and flow tests at 1.25 and 1.5 km depths. The tests were performed in two well-instrumented testbeds in the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. The testbed for Experiment 1 at 1.5 km depth contained two open wells for injection and production and six instrumented monitoring wells surrounding the targeted stimulation zone. Four multi-step stimulation tests targeting hydraulic fracturing and nearly year-long ambient temperature and chilled water flow tests were performed in Experiment 1. The testbed for Experiments 2 and 3 was at 1.25 km depth and contained five open wells in an outwardly fanning five-spot pattern and two fans of well-instrumented monitoring wells surrounding the targeted stimulation zone. Experiment 2 targeted shear stimulation, and Experiment 3 targeted low-flow, high-flow, and oscillating pressure stimulation strategies. Hydraulic fracturing was successful in Experiments 1 and 3 in generating a connected system wherein injected water could be collected. However, the resulting flow was distributed dynamically, and not entirely collected at the anticipated production well. Thermal breakthrough was not observed in the production well, but that could have been masked by the Joule-Thomson effect. Shear stimulation in Experiment 2 did not occur – despite attempting to pressurize the fractures most likely to shear – because of the inability to inject water into a mostly-healed fracture, and the low shear-to-normal stress ratio. The EGS Collab experiments are described to provide a background for lessons learned on topics including induced seismicity, the correlation between seismicity and permeability, distributed and dynamic flow systems, thermoelastic and pressure effects, shear stimulation, local geology, thermal breakthrough, monitoring stimulation, grouting boreholes, modeling, and system management.",

Although modular design may or may not be an optimal response to a given environment (typically understood as a given optimization problem), modular design shines in the far more important realm of innovation, which is driven by the recombination of knowledge. The concepts of encapsulation and information hiding in the theory of modular systems turn out to be analogous in many ways to the principles of constitutional design articulated in constitutional political economy. The paper considers the difficulty of creating a modularconstitutional structure as well as the threats to established modular-constitutional systems that arise from rent seeking and externalities, including intangible externalities or moralisms.

Data collection involved the use of a self-administered questionnaire consisting of six scales. These scales exhibit Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranging from 0.74 to 0.90. The construct validity was confirmed through confirmatory factor analysis. The structural equation modeling method was employed to test the validity of the model using Mplus Software.Results: The model provided fitted well with the empirical data (χ2\/df =1.74, CFI = 0.93; TLI = 0.91; RMSEA = 0.05; SRMR = 0.06). The VAW accounted for 33 percent of the variance through its set of variables. Among these, ATT, RES, and COP directly impacted VAW, while SS and SE had indirect effects. ATT exhibited the most significant overall influence on VAW, with RES and COP serving as mediators among other antecedents studied in relation to VAW.Conclusion: The current findings suggest that violence against Myanmar migrant women residing in Thailand is associated with many factors. Understanding these factors can provide valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to develop and implement awareness and community-based intervention programs.

To address these challenges, this study aimed to estimate water quality parameters through the integration of satellite remote sensing and machine learning techniques. Multispectral reflectance data from the Landsat 8 OLI sensor were collected at various river sites and compared with in-situ data. Both stepwise regression (SWR) and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) models were employed to estimate water temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels.

Spatial maps generated by the RBFNN model illustrated variations in water quality parameters, with lower DO levels downstream due to proximity to the sea and higher water temperatures in the upper stream, confirming an inverse relationship between DO and temperature. The higher accuracy of the RBFNN models facilitates real-time monitoring, enabling immediate responses to contamination and improved resource management. Integrating remote sensing with machine learning provides a comprehensive assessment of the river&apos;s water quality, essential for preserving the delicate ecosystem of the Pahang River and protecting the communities that depend on it.",

Mutations in SLC13A5 cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy type-25 (EIEE25, SLC13A5 Epilepsy) due to impaired citrate uptake in neurons and astrocytes. Despite clinical identification of disease-causing mutations, underlying mechanisms and cures remain elusive. Here we mechanistically classify six frequent SLC13A5 mutations by phenotyping their protein cell surface expression and citrate transport functions. Mutants C50R, T142M, and T227M exhibit impaired citrate transport despite normal expression at the cell surface. In contrast, mutations G219R, S427L, and L488P show low total protein expression levels, absence of mature, glycosylated proteins at the cell surface, retention of the proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, and diminished transport activity. This mechanistic classification divides SLC13A5 mutants into two groups, Class I (C50R, T142M, and T227M) and Class II (G219R, S427L, and L488P). Importantly, mutants’ mRNA levels resemble wildtype, suggesting post-translational defects.. Class II mutations display immature core-glycosylation and shortened half-lives, indicating protein folding defects. Together, these experiments provide a comprehensive understanding of the disease-causing mutation’s defects in SLC13A5 Epilepsy at the biochemical and molecular level and shed light into the trafficking pathway(s) of NaCT. The two classes of mutations will require fundamentally different approaches for treatment to either restore transport function of the mutant protein that is capable of reaching the cell surface (Class I), or therapies that enable the correction of protein folding defects to enable escape to the cell surface where it may restore transport function (Class II).",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "One of the primary goals of roadway design is to reduce undesirable driving errors and induce preferred driving behavior. To assess the efficacy of roadway design, extensive research has utilized crash data or crash surrogates as evaluation indicators. However, both crash- and surrogate-based studies are limited in investigating the efficacy of roadway design on the induction of safe driving behavior. As such, this study proposes the use of Design-Related Behavior (DRB) indicators from the perspective of human factors to evaluate the efficacy of certain roadway design elements. The task analysis method was employed to identify the driving tasks and subtasks from perceptual, cognitive, and behavioral perspectives as drivers approach and navigate intersections. This study focuses on the subtasks that are critical for guiding drivers into appropriate lanes at intersections. Design-Related Behavior (DRB) indicators were developed based on these subtasks, including (1) undesirable driving behaviors (UDBs) and (2) crash surrogates during these UDBs. Crash surrogates were measured by traffic conflicts with time-to-collision (TTC) during UDBs. As a case study, an urban intersection where an unshadowed exclusive left-turn lane was redesigned into a full-shadowed one was selected to assess the impact of improper roadway design elements on DRB indicators. Vehicle trajectory and video data collected from millimeter-wave radar and camera were fused and processed to extract DRB indicators. Our results show that undesirable driving behaviors (UDBs) were reduced by 61.3%, particularly in the transition area after the redesign. Moreover, crash surrogates during UDBs decreased by 68%. Altogether, the development of DRB indicators is promising in better connecting certain roadway design elements with the types of UDBs and their associated crash surrogates.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Cells use epigenetic mechanisms to regulate gene expression. Using these approaches, cells can adjust the amount of messenger RNA and protein generated in response to a specific environmental stimulation. Compared to various studies focusing on genetics, epigenetics research is relatively new. The main epigenetic mechanisms include the well-understood phenomenon of DNA methylation, histone changes, and control by non-coding RNAs, a regulation method that was only recently uncovered and is a subject of intensive continuing research. Epigenetic mechanisms are involved in most diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Epigenetic mechanisms have a significant role in the development of liver cancer i.e. hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant oncologic concern with a poor prognosis. Many genetic and epigenetic changes that occur throughout the etiology of HCC have recently been found using particular molecular methods. It has been identified that various factors, such as tobacco smoking, alcohol, environmental contaminants, and biological agents may change epigenetic patterns in HCC. The study of epigenetics in the liver is significant since it is one of the organs that is continually responding to highly changeable environmental settings. In this review, we center on (1) epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and (2) factors influencing epigenetic changes in hepatocellular carcinoma.",

This landscape seems to have not only degraded consumer welfare in general terms but also harmed marginalized communities. As examples, high prices levy greater costs on uninsured people who are more likely to forego treatment while medical bills constitute a primary reason why Americans declare bankruptcy. Helping to explain this state of affairs, hospitals, providers, and doctors adhere to a curious type of practice about prices: there are no prices. By preventing comparison shopping, opacity seems to restrict competition, erect barriers to entry, and enable firms to charge supracompetitive prices. So why hasn't antitrust law scrutinized one of the most anomalous, unique, and perhaps anticompetitive practices in healthcare?&nbsp; \n<br>\n<br>\n<div>\n One theory has surfaced that opaque pricing is procompetitive. The assertion is that providers and hospitals would collude (even more) if prices were known; absent knowledge of each other's rates, hospitals cannot supposedly fix them. Put differently, opacity appears to satisfy antitrust law because it is ostensibly the presence of visible prices that enables collusion. Helping to explain this argument's success, some authorities have treated healthcare with an antithetical approach to antitrust's conventional principles in that competition is said to harm patients and consumers. Antitrust courts have even called hospitals \"good citizens\" who wouldn't abuse their monopoly power. As a result, pricing opacity has largely evaded antitrust scrutiny even though U.S. healthcare bears the traits of an uncompetitive market.&nbsp; \n <br>\n <br>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n This Article argues that opaque pricing must, in many instances, incur antitrust review.

		"AB_TITLE" : "<span>The Evolving Thread Landscape Pf Ai-Powered Cyberattacks:A Multi-Faceted Approach to Defense And Mitigate<\/span>&nbsp;",
		"AB_CONTENT" : "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized numerous industries, enhancing efficiency and innovation. However, this technological advancement also presents a doubleedged sword, as cybercriminals increasingly leverage AI to orchestrate sophisticated cyberattacks (Goodfellow et al., 2018; Mühlbauer et al., 2022). This article explores the evolving threat landscape of AI-powered cyberattacks and proposes a multi-faceted approach to defense and mitigation. AI's capacity to analyze vast amounts of data, predict patterns, and learn autonomously makes it an invaluable tool for attackers (Cheng et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022). These AI-driven threats range from automated phishing schemes and advanced malware to largescale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, all characterized by their precision, adaptability, and ability to evade traditional cybersecurity measures (Cheng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2023). AI-powered cyberattacks pose significant risks across various sectors, including finance, healthcare, and government (Crosman, 2021; Zeng et al., 2022). The financial sector, for instance, faces AI-enhanced fraud detection evasion, while the healthcare industry is vulnerable to attacks on medical devices and patient data theft (Friedman, 2022; Borenstein et al., 2023). Governmental institutions are not spared, with AI facilitating espionage and critical infrastructure sabotage (Morris, 2021; Johnson et al., 2022). The implications of such attacks are far-reaching, potentially leading to substantial financial losses, erosion of consumer trust, and even threats to national security (Harrison et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2023). In response to these escalating threats, a comprehensive, multi-faceted defense strategy is imperative. This approach integrates cutting-edge technology, robust policies, and human vigilance (Nguyen et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023). Advanced AI-driven cybersecurity solutions, such as machine learning-based anomaly detection systems, can identify and respond to threats in real time (Cheng et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2023). Additionally, adopting AI for proactive threat hunting and predictive analysis can preempt attacks before they materialize (Xie et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023). However, technology alone is insufficient. Cybersecurity policies must be dynamic, evolving in tandem with the threat landscape (Smith et al., 2022; Wright et al., 2023). Regular updates to security protocols, mandatory AI ethics guidelines, and stringent regulatory frameworks are essential to fortify defenses (Rosenberg et al., 2023; Jones &amp; Miller, 2024). Moreover, the human element remains a critical component of cybersecurity. Continuous training and awareness programs for employees, coupled with a culture of cybersecurity mindfulness, can mitigate risks posed by social engineering and insider threats (Green &amp; Thompson, 2022; Patel et al., 2023). Interdisciplinary collaboration between AI experts, cybersecurity professionals, and&nbsp;policymakers is crucial to developing resilient defense mechanisms (Davis et al., 2023; O'Connor, 2024). The future of AI-powered cyberattacks will likely witness an escalation in complexity and frequency, necessitating an arms race between attackers and defenders (Zhang et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). A proactive, multi-faceted approach to defense and mitigation is essential to safeguard digital infrastructures and maintain trust in an increasingly interconnected world (Nguyen et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023). This article underscores the urgent need for a holistic strategy, blending technological innovation, policy adaptation, and human vigilance to combat the growing menace of AI-powered cyber threats (Smith et al., 2022; O'Connor, 2024).",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "There is limited evidence of repeated occupations by Neanderthals or modern humans in the part of Central Germany that roughly corresponds to the present-day Federal State of Hesse. The Lahn Valley located in the southwestern sector of this region is an exception. Based on early excavations of the now destroyed sites, the Lahn Valley has yielded sparse evidence of Neanderthal occupation from the Middle Paleolithic and has produced a more substantive Upper Paleolithic sequence including the Aurignacian, Gravettian, and Magdalenian, as reflected in the lithic and organic material culture. The present study attempted (i) to gain greater understanding of the chronology and use of animals by humans in the Wildscheuer cave, and (ii) to contextualize the Lahn Valley in the broader Paleolithic landscape of Central Europe. We targeted over a dozen samples consisting of faunal remains with fresh fractures, osseous artifacts and human remains that derive from the cave site. The results confirm the previous findings with the dates concentrated around the middle-to-late Aurignacian. These data suggest that, unlike cave-rich areas to the south (i.e. the Swabian Jura), the Wildscheuer was occupied not immediately when modern humans arrived in the region but also that multiple occupational events took place during the remainder of the Upper Paleolithic. This aligns with the ursid remains from the nearby Wildweiberlei, which predate the human occupation. Conversely, our dating efforts did not find evidence of substantial Gravettian or Magdalenian occupation, although this may also be a result of our modest sample size. In addition, ZooMS analysis revealed one of the first evidence of the use of wooly rhinoceros in the production of osseous artifacts such as smoothers. This study calls for renewed attention to the Lahn Valley as archaeometric methods that may be applied to legacy materials improve, and in tandem with our greater understanding of the early to late Upper Paleolithic in Central Europe on a regional to sub-regional scale.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) has become a widely used technique for safeguarding sensitive information in deep learning applications. Unfortunately, DP-SGD&apos;s per-sample gradient clipping and uniform noise addition during training can significantly degrade model utility and fairness. To enhance the utility and fairness of the model, researchers have proposed various adaptive DP-SGD methods by modifying the noise multiplier or the clipping threshold.  However, we observe that the latest DP-SGD-Global-Adapt&apos;s average gradient norm is the same throughout the training. Even when it is integrated with the existing linear decay noise multiplier, it has little or no advantage. Moreover, we notice that its upper clipping threshold increases exponentially towards the end of training, potentially impacting the model&apos;s convergence. Other algorithms, DP-PSAC, Auto-S, DP-SGD-Global, and DP-F, have utility and fairness that are similar to or worse than DP-SGD, as demonstrated in experiments. To overcome these problems and improve utility and fairness, we developed the DP-SGD-Global-Adapt-V2-S (step). It has a step-decay noise multiplier and an upper clipping threshold that is also decayed step-wise. DP-SGD-Global-Adapt-V2-S with a privacy budget ($\\epsilon$) of 1 improves accuracy by 0.9795\\%, 0.6786\\%, and 4.0130\\% in MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, respectively.

A porous medium (ion exchange or ultrafiltration membrane) permitting electromigration of only sinapic acid and retaining the proteins was utilized under two different potential differences. The electro-separation of sinapic acid relied on electrostatic and electrophoretic forces, which cause their adsorption and permeation.

In this production system, chickens are exposed to infectious forms of parasites as a result of the outdoor access and scavenging behaviour. Heterakis gallinarum is one of the most common nematode parasites present in the environment, and estimating its global and regional prevalence is essential for attributing the economic losses in extensive backyard chickens. The objective of this study is to predict the prevalence of heterakidosis in extensive backyard chickens at global and regional levels in LMICs using regression imputation methods. A binomial random effect model was developed using empirical data on heterakidosis prevalence and climatic factors as main predictors. Prevalence data were then imputed in all regions based on the regression model. Global and country prevalence were estimated based on regional predictions and their beta distributions. Minimum precipitation, minimum temperature and maximum temperature were selected as significant predictors. The overall prevalence of heterakidosis was 0.24 (0.19-0.29). Countries with continental and dry climates had a higher mean prevalence, whereas countries with tropical climates had a lower mean prevalence of heterakidosis. As more empirical data on heterakidosis prevalence become available, this model and predictions should be redefined and updated to capture a more representative association and increase the accuracy of the predictions. The results of this study can be used to attribute the economic losses of extensive backyard chickens, taking into account a holistic approach as promoted by the GBADs programme and therefore, to identify which diseases are more costly to backyard farmers.

Little is known regarding the influence of prolonged crowding stress on the immunity of juvenile pearl gentian groupers. However, research exploring the potential mechanisms through which crowding stress affects fish immune function is limited. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of crowding stress on the immune stress of the pearl gentian grouper juvenile (♀Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ Epinephelus lanceolatus) under prolonged conditions. We focused on the pearl gentian grouper juvenile and selected low- and high-density groups as the experimental breeding densities. Research shows that crowding stress increases the activities of ACP and AKP and reduces the activities of LZM and IgM content. RNA sequencing and comparative transcriptomic analyses were employed to explore changes in the gene expression of juvenile pearl gentian groupers subjected to crowding stress. Differential gene expression analyses between the low- and high-density groups identified 5777 unigenes that were differentially expressed following crowding stress, with 3216 and 2561 upregulated and downregulated, respectively. In the GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, many of the enriched signaling pathways related to genes were associated with immunity and oxidative stress. In addition, the combined analyses of enzyme activity and transcriptomics indicated that crowding stress suppressed the immune function of juvenile pearl gentian groupers, reducing their immune ability. Overall, these findings offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying crowding stress tolerance in juvenile pearl gentian grouper, suggesting that the NF-κB pathway plays a crucial role in the immune response of the head kidney of the pearl gentian grouper juvenile to long-term crowding stress.",

		"AB_TITLE" : "Whole-Rock and Zircon Geochemistry of the Tieshan Pluton in Daye, Eastern China: Implication for Petrogenesis and Fe-Cu-Au-(Co) Mineralization",
		"AB_CONTENT" : "The Tieshan pluton is situated in the Daye region of the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Valley metallogenic belts. It consists mainly of quartz diorite and host abundant mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs) and is associated with the renowned Daye Fe-Cu-Au-(Co) skarn deposit. The presence of disequilibrium textures in MMEs, including quenched margins, acicular apatite and elongated amphibole, provides evidence that the pluton underwent magma mixing involving mafic and felsic magma. In comparison with the Fe (4.20 wt% on average), Cu (28 ppm on average) and Co (10 ppm on average) concentrations in the quartz diorite, the Fe (7.26 wt% on average) and Cu (57 ppm on average) concentrations are doubled and Co (29 ppm on average) are tripled in MMEs. The recharge of mafic magma, therefore, likely adding significant amount of Fe, Cu and Co metals into the felsic magma, therefore enhancing the fertility of the Tieshan pluton.Zircons from both quartz diorite and MMEs of the Tieshan pluton exhibit similar U-Pb ages, with average of 138.2 ± 1.6 Ma and 138.6 ± 0.94 Ma, respectively. The zircon εHf(t) values of the Tieshan pluton (ranging from -17.4 to -14.8) closely match to those of the Cu-Fe-Au fertile granitoids in the Daye region. Zircons from the Tieshan quartz diorite display Yb\/Dy and Eu\/Eu* ratios ranging from 3.58 to 4.19 and 0.40 to 0.60, respectively. These ratios suggest substantial amphibole fractionation with minimal plagioclase fractionation and indicate high magmatic water contents. This is corroborated by the zircon oxybarometer-hygrometer analysis, which estimates the melt H2O content to be between 8.27 and 10.27 wt%. The zircons from the Tieshan quartz diorite exhibit higher Ce4+\/Ce3+ ratios (ranging from 67 to 201) and greater oxygen fugacity (logfO2 values of ΔFMQ = +2.06 to +2.76) compared to those from the MMEs, which have zircon Ce4+\/Ce3+ ratios between 18 and 110 and logfO2 values of ΔFMQ = +1.11 to +2.32. The calculated zircon Ce4+\/Ce3+ ratios and oxygen fugacity (logfO2) for the quartz diorite from Tieshan pluton are comparable to the values of Tonglushan Cu-Fe-Au related fertile quartz diorite, indicating the similar oxygen fugacity of the Cu-Fe-Au ore-related magmas in Daye region. Our research demonstrates that the geochemistry of whole-rock and zircon is a powerful tool for identifying granitoids with potential for skarn Fe-Cu-Au-(Co) mineralization. Integrating with structural geological studies, geophysical signature analysis, and assessments of hydrothermal alteration halo can provide a comprehensive and effective approach for exploring skarn Fe-Cu-Au-(Co) deposits in the Daye region.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "The practical requirements for maintaining machine operability often conflict with the data needs for training prognostics models due to the limited availability of run-to-failure (RTF) data in industry settings. This scarcity is exacerbated by irregular and infrequent inspections, resulting in sparse datasets. The literature tends to address this challenge by trajectory data augmentation methods which creates more RTF data by transformations on available trajectories, but these methods still require some trajectories to begin with. To address the challenge faced by industries where running any machine to failure without intervention is impractical, we propose a diagnostics feature similarity-based method to construct full RTF trajectories from partial data, which is then used in a graph neural network for prognostics. Unlike conventional graph-based prognostics that primarily model sensor interactions through static graph structures, this research explores fault propagation as an evolving gralph, a novel approach in the application of GNNs. It posits that condition monitoring data from various machines across diverse health states can effectively generate prognostic insights and model degradation evolution as a dynamic graph with physically meaningful node-edge embeddings. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated through its application in a hydrogenerator prognostics case study involving multiple fault states.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "After a disaster, the needs of the affected people dispersed in a large area can be highly uncertain. To make effective relief distribution plans, humanitarian organizations must first conduct needs assessment activities to understand the prevalence of needs in the affected area. This involves visiting several sites and collecting information from key informants (i.e., affected people) through interviews. Given the urgency of needs assessment, it is important to consider the time spent for traveling between selected sites and for gathering information at each site, which may highly affect the accuracy of assessments.This paper introduces the Assessment Routing Problem with Coverage and Accuracy, which addresses the logistical planning and sampling decisions of a post-disaster needs assessment team. The problem involves determining which sites to visit, in what sequence, and how much time to spend at each site to collect information within a total assessment time limit. We present a mathematical model that supports devising an assessment plan by considering objectives related to site coverage and sampling accuracy. To solve real-world instances efficiently, we propose a constructive heuristic and a tabu search algorithm. Computational experiments demonstrate that the tabu search algorithm can quickly obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions for large instances, while the performance of the heuristic is influenced by network topology. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study based on the 2011 Van Earthquake in Turkey.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Over the past few years, medical image processing has increased in use of deep learning algorithms, especially in the analysis of magnetic resonance (MR) scans. MRI is a crucial diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent type of dementia that ranks seventh among fatal illnesses globally. As there is no known cure for Alzheimer's disease, early detection and intervention are vital to prevent its irreversible progression. This study proposes a comprehensive framework for detecting Alzheimer's disease that employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning approaches. We applied transfer learning to pretrained deep learning models rather than training them from scratch. Three distinct pretrained CNN models (VGG-19, ResNet-50, and Inception V3) with a fine-tuned transfer learning approach were used for five-way classification of AD. We employed the ADNI dataset, which includes MRI scans from 608 patients across five classes: Alzheimer's disease (AD), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and normal control (NC). The models' performance was evaluated based on eight metrics: accuracy, precision, sensitivity\/recall, specificity, error rate, false positive rate, F1-score, and kappa. Our findings indicate that the ResNet-50 architecture outperformed other pretrained models, achieving the highest overall accuracy of 98.7% for multiclass AD classification. Additionally, the ResNet-50 model excelled in classifying the EMCI category with an accuracy of 99.25%, indicating its effectiveness in detecting early signs of memory impairment. The proposed framework surpasses the performance of previous studies in terms of overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, setting a new benchmark for five-way AD classification. The outcomes of this study will contribute significantly to early prevention efforts by enabling Alzheimer's disease to be detected before it progresses irreversibly. In conclusion, this research represents a promising approach for improving the early detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease using deep learning methods with MRI data.",

We find that investors’ higher order beliefs provide substantial motivations for non-fundamental speculation, e.g., to buy into a stock market perceived to be overvalued.

The increasing focus on geological hydrogen storage and CO2 capture, utilization, and sequestration highlights the critical need for reliable in-situ stress estimation. The relationship between horizontal stress, pore pressure, and fracture gradient significantly predicts the safe range of drilling fluid weight, avoiding kick, wellbore instability, and loss of circulation material. The challenges in estimating horizontal stress include lacking information on rock properties, which requires open-hole well tests and coring analysis. These techniques collaborate to estimate the stresses in a specific area but do not apply to all scenarios. Unlike other proposed methods, the Warpinski method proposes an approach for elastic and viscoelastic rock behavior, introducing the relationship between stress and strain when deriving horizontal stress. This paper contributes to the field by exploring the Warpinski Method to incorporate thermal effects. Different from previous studies that primarily focused on geothermal static conditions, this research investigates the dynamic influence of temperature changes on in-situ stress and strain predictions. The preliminary data were derived from a prior study referenced throughout the paper, providing interpretation of indirect field rock mechanical measurements via commercial software packages such as Interactive Petrophysics (IP) and SEST TR. 2.0© .

Despite minimal changes in pH, considerable color alterations were observed, especially under TP, which lowered the lightness (L*) value of kimchi juice. Analysis of antioxidant activity showed that the ferric-reducing antioxidant power and phenol content were noticeably reduced, especially in TP, resulting in decreased antioxidant activity. In addition, HHP effectively preserved the original volatile flavor components of kimchi, whereas TP significantly reduced the major sulfur components essential for the taste of kimchi.

The hydrophobic surface of plastics have been shown to adsorb organic contaminants and alter the rate of chemical uptake in fishes. Per-fluorinated organic chemicals such as Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are highly hydrophobic chemicals known to adsorb to hydrophobic surfaces. We hypothesized that the presence of nano-sized plastic particles could bind PFOA and alter both the physical-chemical properties of the plastics and also enhance PFOA uptake into organisms. Using radiolabelled 14C-PFOA as a tracer, we measured direct unidirectional uptake of PFOA in juvenile Pacific Oysters (Magallana gigas) at different (25, 50, and 100 µg \/ L) concentrations, for different exposure periods (1, 2, 4, and 6 h) and investigated whether varying concentrations (100, 500, 1000 µg \/ L) of either 500 nm or 20 nm polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs) differentially altered the uptake rate of PFOA. Our results demonstrate that PFOA adsorbs to the surface of PS-NPs,  altering PS-NP behaviour in solution and significantly increases the rate of uptake of PFOA in exposed Pacific oysters. PFOA uptake at 100 μg\/L was increased 2.3-fold in the presence of 1000 μg\/L 500 nm PS-NP and 3.2-fold in the presence of 1000 μg\/L 20 nm PS-NP.

These can be used for training artificial intelligence (AI) models to recognize diseases when there is a shortage of images. These Generative Adversarial Nets, or GANs, utilize two neural networks that work opposingly to construct further refined and more realistic deepfake images. Although these images can be used for training AI models, they can also end up being used by attackers to corrupt images that are seen by medical professionals as real. Consequently, these forms of falsified information have begun to percolate through numerous fields and generated an increased concern in the protections that exist against the dissemination of deepfake images, and the privacy of individuals pictured. Going beyond general harassment or misinformation, these deepfakes could be used in various fields to cause new methods of harm. In particular, the medical industry has begun to consider the implications that could result from the progression of generative image technology and question the data security present in medical imaging storage technologies, commonly known as picture archiving and communication systems, or PACS. It is possible to deepfake medical images that inject or remove portions of the image and potentially alter patient diagnoses. Accordingly, the protection against the production and dissemination of deepfake images within the medical field is necessary to uphold the integrity of medical imaging. Without proper identification of diseases through medical imaging, patients may be at risk for incredibly costly misdiagnoses that may also lead to complications or even cost them their life.

Even though deepfake medical images are used in positive ways to train AI driven medical diagnosis, serious harm and wasted resources are potentially caused by deepfake medical images. This research calls for policy to proactively call for reasonable measures to ensure validity of medical imaging. Moreover, this research will assess previously identified security implementations, such as digital watermarking, blockchain technology, or other solutions.

However, comprehending the uplift history of different blocks on TP remains an exceedingly intricate task.

In this study, we collected and analyzed palynological samples from the Miocene Xiayoushashan Formation and Shangyoushashan Formation of the Wulan Basin to investigate the relationship between climate change and TP uplift. Our analysis revealed four distinct pollen zones: Zone I (18-15.3 Ma), characterized by Artemisia-Lycopodium-Aster-Polygonaceae; Zone II (15.3-12.7 Ma), dominated by Pinus-Picea-Aster-Artemisia; Zone III (12.7-11.7 Ma), featuring Lycopodium-Picea-Pinus-Polygonaceae; Zone IV (11.7-9.7 Ma), exhibiting Picea-Chenopodiaceae-Lycopodium-Artemisia composition. The results indicate that shrubs and grasses mixed with conifers and broad-leaved trees prevailed in the Wulan Basin&apos;s paleovegetation during 18-8.7 Ma, displaying a vertical zonal vegetation pattern. By employing Coexistence Likelihood Estimation (CRACLE) method, we estimated that the mean annual temperature (MAT) ranged from 6.0~14.7°C, while the mean annual precipitation (MAP) was estimated to be between 919.1~1612.4 mm. The climate exhibited minor fluctuations but was significantly warmer and more humid compared to present conditions, representing a cool-temperate and sub-humid climate. Based on differences in MAT values, we estimated that the paleoelevation of the Wulan Basin during the Miocene was approximately 1655-2025 m, implying an uplift of around 1275-1645 m since then.

In this context, analyzing the interactions between AVs and HVs is of great importance. Previous studies have primarily relied on observational data and conventional statistical methods within multi-screen 2D drivingsimulators. However, the driving environment is inherently complex, and various factors often interact in ways that can significantly impact outcomes. A major challenge with these approaches is their inability to effectively isolate the influence of confounding factors, which can skew the results and hinder accurate interpretations. To address this issue, a causal inference-based study focusing on driving behavior indicators like time to collision is conducted with participants to measure discrepancies when following AVs and HVs in a high-fidelity VR-enabled driving simulator. The participants are recruited to drive HVs in a CARLA built-in map, interacting with an AV or HV in a T-intersection without traffic signals. The experimental results reveal that human drivers maintain greater distances, more focused attention, and drive more cautiously when following AVs compared to HVs, indicating a significant initial distrust towards AVs. However, over time and repeated interactions, these behavioral differences diminish, suggesting a potential increase in trust and adaptation to AVs. This finding contrasts with earlier studies that did not observe such a trend, highlighting the importance of considering long-term behavioral changes in mixed traffic scenarios. Notably, the use of causal inference provides a more nuanced understanding of these changes. It effectively addresses the impact of covariates, distinguishing this study from previous ones that relied solely on statistical analysis. The practical significance of this study lies in its potential to inform the design and deployment strategies of AVs, ensuring safer and more efficient integration into current traffic systems. By understanding how human drivers adapt to AVs over time, policymakers and manufacturers can develop better guidelines and technologies to promote a seamless and safe transition to mixed traffic environments. All driving experimental data in this study is available as open-source at https:\/\/zenodo.org\/doi\/10.5281\/zenodo.10695253.",

Building on the multilevel interaction perspective of Coleman’s bathtub” framework, this study examines whether and how the governance quality at the country level influences the early internationalization of start-ups. Empirical analysis using multilevel data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor confirms that the governance quality of a country directs the flow of social resources by shaping different types of social networks at the firm level, and that social networks in turn constitute important conditions for the early internationalization of start-ups, ultimately manifesting as variations in early internationalization at the country level. By uncovering the interaction between macro-level governance quality and micro-level firms&apos; international activity, we extend the study of international entrepreneurship and institutional theory, while providing a basis for policymakers to develop target-specific policies that promote the internationalization of start-ups.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) can be absorbed by plants, thereby affecting plant physiological activity, regulating gene expression, and altering metabolite content. However, the molecular mechanisms by which exogenous selenium affects plant secondary metabolites remain unclear. We exposed Polygonatum kingianum coll.et Hemsl plants to SeNPs at 0, 10, 25, and 50 mg\/L concentrations. Joint physiological, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analyses were performed to reveal the response mechanisms of major secondary metabolites of P. kingianum to selenium nanoparticles. The maximum selenium accumulation in plants was observed at 25 mg\/L, where the photosynthetic electron transport rate significantly increased, and the carbon-nitrogen ratio significantly decreased. In parallel, the main active components, polysaccharides and saponins, showed a significant increase in content, while flavonoid content decreased. SeNPs affect polysaccharide accumulation mainly through up-regulation of SPS, UGPase, AGPase, UTP, and SUS genes in starch and sucrose metabolic pathways. The accumulation of saponins was affected by upregulating genes in the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathways, including PAD, ADH, PK, and GS. The accumulation of flavonoids was mainly regulated by metabolic pathways such as flavonoid biosynthesis, isoflavonoid biosynthesis, and the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids. In summary, this study reveals the key metabolic pathways affected by nanoselenium in the main secondary metabolic products of P. kingianum.",

In surface waters, concentration of Se(IV), Se(VI) are all low relative to dissolved organic selenium (DOSe), being related to the biological uptake in the euphotic zone. The regeneration of Se in the mesopelagic waters induces that concentration increases with depth for inorganic fraction of dissolved pool, with a systematic change in species ratio, indicating active transformations there.

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Reefs are facing a global decline with sewage pollution emerging as a significant and poorly understood threat. Inadequate wastewater management and disorderly urbanization contributes to water pollution globally. Tropical Southwestern Atlantic comprises a set of oceanic Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) including the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago in Brazil, which has experienced significant population growth driven by tourism development without expanding the sewage infrastructure. We mapped and quantified marine pollution in these MPAs, characterizing pollution sources and evaluating their effects on benthic and fish communities in 13 reef sites. We quantified nutrients, metals and metalloid, microplastics, fecal sterols, and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in both water and sediment samples. We also used isotopic tracing on macroalgae to identify the origin of organic matter and characterized benthic and fish communities, and algae biomass at each site. Pollution was more pronounced in the multiple-use area but also affected no-take areas. Effluents from wastewater treatment plants did not meet legislation standards, and reefs in the multiple-use area were enriched in orthophosphate and ammonia compared to those in the no-take area. Nitrogen isotopes in macroalgae revealed sewage-derived nitrogen throughout the multiple-use area. Sites with nutrient enrichment exhibited higher abundances of fast-growing and opportunistic green macroalgae, and higher biomass of brown macroalgae. We found low PAHs, coprostanol and metal(loid) concentrations (below the probable effect level) in the sediments. However, the port area within the multiple-use area showed higher contaminant levels, suggesting untreated sewage and nautical chemical pollution. Microplastics were widespread in sediment and water samples. This is the first comprehensive assessment of marine pollution at an oceanic environment in Southwestern Atlantic, indicating the pervasive impacts of marine pollution even in oceanic regions and highlighting that local pollution control, including managing sewage and procedures in port areas, are critical to protect oceanic ecosystems in addition to MPAs.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "The lacustrine shale of Qingshankou Formation in southern Songliao Basin is a primary target for current shale oil exploration and development. This study employs multiple methods, including organic petrology analysis, thin section observation and scanning, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), modular automated processing system (MAPS), Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by Scanning Electron Microscopy (QEMSCAN) combined with image processing technology, nitrogen adsorption, and high-pressure mercury injection to comprehensively investigate shale lithofacies characteristics and microscopic pore structures. The research identifies four types of shale lithofacies using the scheme of “organic carbon content (TOC) - laminae characteristics - mineral composition”: low TOC muddy intercalated with shell laminae mixed lithofacies (LMM), medium TOC laminated mixed lithofacies (MMM), medium TOC mixed laminae siliceous lithofacies (MMS), and medium TOC silty-shell-muddy laminae siliceous lithofacies (MLS). The reservoir is controlled by inorganic pores, followed by microfractures in different laminae. Mesopores contribute significantly to storage space and macropores also plays a noticeable role in reservoir capacity among shale lithofacies. LMM lithofacies are regarded as the favorable type with superior structural parameters and the largest storage space. Clay minerals and quartz are key contributors to pore structures, especially those below 100 nm controlled by I\/S mixed-layer and illite, while TOC and feldspar exhibit a negative correlation with pore volumes. Muddy laminae facilitate shale oil accumulation space development, particularly with the support from larger clastic grains.

Four groups were designed with low C\/N ratio groups (13SM+FR, 13SM+FR+MA) and high C\/N ratio groups (SM+FR+MA, SM+FR), among them, SM+FR+MA and 13SM+FR+MA both added 0.4% MA. After 30-days pile composting, the results showed that high C\/N ratios and the addition of MA can significantly enhance the temperature and prolong the thermophilic phase during the composting process. The high C\/N ratio were more conducive to the decomposition of organic matter (OM) and composting maturity. Adding MA promotes the metabolism and transformation of carbohydrates and proteins by altering the activity of enzymes in the thermophilic phase, while weakening pathways such as biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and carbon metabolism during the cooling maturation phase. In contrast to adding MA, adjusting the proportion of raw materials were easier and more effective to reshape the microbial communities in composting.  In addition, composting significantly reduce the abundance of pathogens such as Rhodotorula, Exophiala, Scythalidium, and Lecythophora. Thereby, it is feasible to co-composting FR with SM as a bulking agent for regulating C\/N. Moreover, high C\/N ratio and the addition of MA were a promising strategy that could inhibit pathogens and improve maturity during composting.",

The structure characters were studied by XRD measurement. The optical properties and energy transfer mechanisms between Yb3+, Er3+, and Dy3+ were investigated according to the measured absorption spectra, emission spectra and fluorescence decay curves. The absorption spectra show that the triply-doped crystal could be effective pumped by 980 nm due to the introduced of Yb3+ and Er3+. In comparison with Dy3+ singly-doped CaYAlO4 crystal, a broadened and enhanced ~3 μm MIR emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 286 nm was obtained due to the fact that there exists effective energy transfer process from Yb3+ and Er3+ to Dy3+. For Yb3+, it serves as an effective sensitized ion. For Er3+, it could be not only used as an effective sensitized ion, but also as 2.7 μm MIR emission center. For Dy3+, on the one hand, it can serve as a deactivating ion to solve the self-termination bottleneck effect of Er3+, and more importantly, as an emission center to achieve 3 μm emission. The comprehensive effect is to obtain enhanced and broadened MIR emission in the triply-doped crystal.

There, however, lacks a thorough understanding of CO2 distribution, migration, and transformation in the subsurface over cycles at a field scale. Hence, this work, for the first time, integrates the multi-geomechanical and multi-geochemical impacts to represent the complex CO2-oil-brine-rock interactions and rock stress-sensitivity of a specific unconventional reservoir, which thus generates a well-established three-dimensional microseismic model. The results indicated that 48% of the injected CO2 was stored underground, along with a 3.4% increase in oil recovery. The occurrence of multiple CO2 storage impeded CO2-oil interaction, leading to a 25.9% reduction in the volume of the CO2-oil mixing zone and a 2.2% decrease in the cumulative oil production, yet a 7.7% increase in the storage rate. Cyclic injection mode exerted a significant impact on the migration and transformation of CO2 in the reservoir. After ten cycles, 20% of the injected CO2 (approximately 12,000 tons) was stored long-term through carbonate mineralization (6%), dissolution in water (6%), aqueous ions (4%), and trapped gas (4%).

For this purpose, segmented regression was implemented using a nonlinear optimization solver, to find the breakpoint of the two fitted lines and their respective parameters when the physical property is plotted against the surfactant concentration. The x-coordinate of the broken-stick point represents the CMC. Considering the standard error of the CMC determined by the three techniques, the CMC estimated by conductivity was considered the most reliable and, consequently, taken as reference. Weighted orthogonal distance regression indicates that differences between the CMC obtained by conductivity, density and sound velocity are statistically significant. However, no conclusions can be drawn about C14 alkyl chain due to the CMC uncertainties assessed based on sound velocity and densimetry and, above all, because the CMC dependence with temperature becomes blurred with the increase in the chain length, which prevents the positive validation of the statistical correlation between CMCs. The influence of the counterion cannot be discarded either. Alkyl pyridinium bromide exhibits a less temperature influence on CMC than the homologous chloride which makes it more difficult to correlate the CMC estimated by density or even sound velocity against the reference CMC value predicted by conductimetry.

To address this, the Federal Government has undertaken one of the largest broadband investment programs ever via The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, with the aim of addressing this disparity and expanding broadband connectivity to all citizens. We examine broadband availability, adoption, and need for each US state, and then construct an Input-Output model to explore the potential macroeconomic impacts of broadband spending on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and supply chain linkages. Our analysis indicates that higher funding allocations appear to be allocated to areas with poorer broadband.

The present study reported an eco-friendly and efficient non-mechanical approach: the freeze-thaw coupling ionic liquid-based aqueous two-phase system (FT-IA) that simultaneously dewatered sludge and transformed waste phosphoric acid into hydroxyapatite. The moisture content of the sludge treated by FT-IA conditioning could be significantly reduced from 98.27% to 46.63%, and no additional mechanical dewatering was required. Notably, along with sludge conditioning, waste phosphoric acid was transformed into hydroxyapatite (SP-HAP) with outstanding adsorption capacity for conventional heavy metals compared with commercial HAP. Analyses of bromophenol blue assays, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle revealed that the disruption of hydrophilic functional groups on the surface of sludge flocs led to the release and accumulation of more hydrophobic organic compounds, such as humic acids, on the surface of sludge flocs. These alterations significantly weakened the binding capacity between sludge flocs and water molecules, markedly enhancing the salting-out effect during subsequent IA conditioning. Furthermore, spectroscopic analysis and lactate dehydrogenase analyses showed that a high concentration of ionic liquid and EPS concentrated in the same phase, which could strongly destroy EPS and microbial cells. The high permeability environment promoted the precipitation of exposed proteins, further weakening the binding ability of sludge solids and water molecules, thus enabling the possibility of deep sludge dewatering.

Additionally, declining trends in energy recovery is correlated with higher probability of co-hosting a CMP, possibly indicating a substitution relationship between the two, while increasing waste treatment correlates with CMP presence, indicating potential synergies with other waste management activities. The findings emphasize the role of pollution-intensive industrial hubs in affecting CMP location decisions, informing targeted environmental policies.",

The base case evaluation focuses on the sludges generated at the Fredericia WWTP in Denmark, receiving an organic load of 150k population equivalent (PE). For TEA, a steady-state process simulation is conducted using Aspen Plus®, utilizing a rigorous kinetic HTL-model. The derived mass and energy balances serve as input for the TEA. The findings reveal the significant impact of operational expenditure (OPEX) on overall economics, with utilities, plant maintenace, and salaries constituting a significant proportion of OPEX. Analysis conducted on the Fredericia WWTP indicates that processing 323 kg\/h of dry solids feedstock yields 94 kg\/h of biocrude at a MBSP of 1.4 €\/kg. MBSP varies between 0.9 to 1.8 €\/kg across other evaluated plant sizes (0.1 to 1.0 million PE). By considering a sewage sludge handling credit similar to current costs for disposing sewage sludge or digestate, biocrude can be produced at a competitive to crude oil prices for WWTPs larger that 300k PE.

By modeling the fast-start of fish individual and the startle propagation processes in fish school, the sudden collective evasion phenomenon during the fish collective behavior is studied. Utilizing this model, the paper focuses on investigating the impacts of cluster patterns and individual heterogeneity in social behavior and risk perception on the collective evasion process through simulations. The results show that the density of cluster aggregation is crucial in determining the propagation capability of startle responses. Conversely, the sudden startle propagation may completely change the type of cluster pattern for the cases in transitional zones. In some scenarios, a very small number of behaviorally heterogeneous individuals can dominate the cluster pattern of the entire group. Finally, it is found that distributing individuals with strong perception abilities around the periphery of the group while clustering those with weaker perception abilities within the inner group enhances the overall perception ability of the entire group.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "Effective accumulation and degradation of micropollutants in water has aroused increasing research interest recently. How to improve their removal efficiencies still offers challenges in developing water treatment technologies. Among all the porous materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show great potential in increasing the catalytical properties as well as accumulation abilities, however, this nanomaterial still faces the challenges of water stabilities and limited active sites. Here we offer a strategy to fabricate water-stable hierarchical porous carbons (HPC) derived from tunable core-shell structured metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (5, 10, and 20-ZIF-8@ZIF--67s) with increasing shell thickness using one-step calcination, showing the dual functionals of both adsorption and highly efficient catalysis for removal sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The HPC structure was systematically optimized at increasing temperatures and ratios of two metals. The 10-Co-NHPC-900 at optimal conditions shows both the highest adsorption capacities and initial adsorption rates, which are 4.56 and 10.35 times higher than that of calcinated ZIF-67s. The adsorption and catalytical decomposition mechanisms based on PMS were systematically studied by analyzing oxidant consumption and reactive oxygen species production as well as the by-products of SMX. The Co ions leached amount of 10-Co-NHPC-900 was 63.6 times lower than that of MOF precursor, indicating that the cobalt-based porous catalysts prepared by MOF precursors have higher water stability and reduce secondary pollution.

		"AB_CONTENT" : "The distribution network use-of-system charge is designed to recover network investment costs from users based on their network utilization. However, with the increasing penetration of distributed renewable energy (DRE) and flexible loads, network utilization becomes more uncertain. Traditional pricing models, such as long-run incremental cost pricing (LRIC), simplify these uncertainties and probability distributions by considering users&apos; maximum network utilization levels, resulting in conservative network charges. To address this issue, this study integrates extreme value statistics into the network pricing scheme and develops an extended long-run incremental cost pricing (ELRIC) method. In the proposed ELRIC method, the generalized Pareto distribution is employed to model the tail probabilities of node power injections, and the tail distributions of branch power are derived through a linear power flow model. Pricing and network reinforcement decisions are then guided by the potential branch power exceedance and curtailment costs. In comparison to traditional pricing methods, ELRIC offers a robust and analytical pricing framework in uncertain environments, allowing for the pricing of users&apos; use-of-system charges with various tail characteristics at different predetermined probabilities. A case study on a 59-bus distribution system illustrates the ELRIC model effectively captures the uncertainty of DREs and loads through extreme value statistics and differentiates the use-of-system charge for users with different tail distributions.",

Energy social science and humanities (SSH) scholars in general, and Energy Justice (EnJ) and Energy Ethics authors in particular, have not yet adequately addressed the topic of RE. We contribute to filling this gap by considering three domains of tensions that may emerge from radical environmentalists’ initiatives in the specific context of energy-related projects, processes, policies, and systems. First, we discuss rhetorical tensions concerning different terms and definitions. Although various stakeholders tend to describe the same phenomena through specific linguistic expressions such as “eco-defense”, “civil disobedience”, “ecotage”, or “ecoterrorism”, we note that terminological preferences are value-laden. The choices of labels denote specific connotations, perspectives, agendas, and goals. Moreover, such rhetorical tensions relate to both the interpretation of the phenomena and their implicit or explicit justification. Second, we describe how the different stakeholders (e.g. local communities, non-local activists, media, property and facility owners or representatives, law enforcement, legal representatives, local and national governments) may promote, experience, or suffer socio-political tensions that occur in specific spatio-temporal scales and contexts. While these tensions are usually visible, they can be either tangible and disruptive (e.g., direct actions towards powerplants, pipelines or transmission lines) or symbolic and theatrical (e.g., soup throwing on famous paintings, “cancelling” via social media). Moreover, they can be violent or peaceful, and affect one or more of the phases of the energy cycle (i.e., extraction, generation, transmission, marketing, end-use). Third, we examine the ways in which RE drives normative tensions. On the one hand, historically speaking, certain RE initiatives (e.g., direct actions, civil disobedience, strikes, sit-ins, boycotts) often mean to create tensions to inspire change, forcing society as a whole to explore alternative social norms and challenging institutions and people in positions of power to consider new laws, policies, and political agendas. In this case, the tensions themselves are envisioned as transformative tools, the means of change. On the other hand, normative tensions arise when considering the often-strained relation between “what is moral” and “what is legal”. This tension relates directly to a certain RE initiative’s moral justifiability, hence its moral, legal, and socio-political legitimacy. In light of these tensions, we argue that RE challenges energy social science and humanities (SSH) scholars to think about EnJ more radically and broadly. To this end, we propose a non-anthropocentric, intergenerational Energy Ethics informed by Environmental Ethics scholarship, inspired by Just War Theory, and aligned with the ambitions of UN SDG 13. The study contributes to energy SSH scholarship and particularly to EnJ and Energy Ethics discourses.",

		"AB_CONTENT" : "The concept of Power-to-X (PtX) has gained significant attention in recent years as a means of converting excess renewable energy into alternative forms of energy carriers, fuels, or chemicals. This technology has the potential to address the issue of renewable energy curtailment, which is challenging in the transition to a low-carbon economy. One specific type of PtX is Power-to-Gas (PtG), which converts excess renewable electricity into hydrogen or methane via water electrolysis. Hydrogen generation form of PtG, in particular, can serve as a long-term energy storage mechanism by being converted back into electricity through a gas-to-power system or fuel cell. The integration of hydrogen-based storage techniques into energy systems offers numerous benefits, including increased supply reliability and carbon neutrality. This paper explores the integration of a green hydrogen chain within a microgrid, combining PtG and Gas-to-Power (GtP) technologies to achieve a net-zero energy and carbon system. To achieve this, a high-resolution linear model with a whole-year planning horizon is developed to capture short-term and long-term storage opportunities offered by hydrogen. The model includes detailed and novel metathetical models of photovoltaic panels and the compression process of hydrogen, taking various governing factors into account. The developed model seeks to size the hydrogen chain equipment cost-effectively within the whole microgrid planning process. The results of implementing the model on a real-world case study indicate that the total cost of implementing a net-zero carbon microgrid increases by at least 110.5% when compared to a system without hydrogen storage but with a significant reduction in shed load (4%). The cost increase varies from 5% to over 50% for near-zero carbon systems, depending on supply reliability. Overall, the study demonstrates the economic benefits and feasibility of deploying green hydrogen to achieve net-zero energy and carbon microgrids in practical cases.",

Our analysis shows that, by properly setting the per-unit transaction fee, the platform can always avoid head-to-head competition with the seller, regardless of the level of horizontal differentiation. Mandating data-sharing, which allows the seller to also price discriminate, does not seem to solve this problem and, in fact, aggravates it further, generally benefiting the platform. The seller is better off only if it is less efficient than the platform, whereas consumers are worse off. We propose that preventing the platform from adjusting the fee after the data-sharing mandate is not enough to reinstate competition in the downstream market. We then show that banning the hybrid business model and forbidding the use of data for price discrimination increase consumer surplus, even if the seller becomes a monopolist.
